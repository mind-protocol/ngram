## CURRENT STATE

**Status: FUNCTIONAL** — TUI working with agent integration (Claude, Gemini, or Codex).
Entry point is `ngram` (no subcommand).

Recent stability work:
- Conversation history guards (non-positive limits, copy-on-read)
- Agent activity checks include subprocess returncode
- Agent handle de-duplication and empty message suppression
- Manager drift detection path normalization and PTY state handling
- Verified `ngram/tui/widgets/status_bar.py` already implements reported methods; no code changes needed.

Module mapping:
- `modules.yaml` includes `tui` module mapping under `modules`

Doc maintenance:
- Implementation doc references normalized to avoid broken-link false positives
- Implementation overview references now point to `ngram/repair_core.py` and full TUI command paths
- Manager startup reference uses relative paths to `.ngram/CLAUDE.md` and `.ngram/agents/manager/AGENTS.md`
- Structure doc points to `../PATTERNS_TUI_Design.md` and `ngram/tui/app.py` for file references
- Data flow diagram uses full file paths for command and repair routing
- Implementation details split into `docs/tui/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture/` with an overview entry point
- Runtime implementation content consolidated into `IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture_Structure.md` to avoid duplicate docs
- Structure doc file list updated for new widgets and theme files
- Re-verified IMPLEMENTATION doc backtick references for STALE_IMPL; all paths resolve
- Clarified suggestions bar label in the structure doc file list

Archived detail:
- Historical feature list, handoffs, and observations moved to `docs/tui/archive/SYNC_archive_2024-12.md`

---

## IN PROGRESS

- Queue management for >3 issues in repair

---

## PLANNED FEATURES (HIGH LEVEL)

- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Auto-refresh SYNC display on file change
- `/repair --max N` configurable concurrency
- Tab layout for >3 agents

---

## KNOWN GAPS

- Tab layout for >3 agents not fully implemented
- Agent queue processing (issues beyond first 3) not implemented

---

## AGENT OBSERVATIONS

### Remarks
- Large sync content archived to keep module docs within size targets.
- Verified `ConversationMessage.to_dict` and `AgentHandle.duration` are implemented in `ngram/tui/state.py` during INCOMPLETE_IMPL repair review; no code changes required.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Keep doctor-ignore and SYNC notes updated together to avoid drift.

### Propositions
- None
