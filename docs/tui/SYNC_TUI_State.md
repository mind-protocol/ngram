## CURRENT STATE

**Status: FUNCTIONAL** — TUI working with agent integration (Claude, Gemini, or Codex).
Entry point is `ngram` (no subcommand).

Recent stability work:
- Conversation history guards (non-positive limits, copy-on-read)
- Agent activity checks include subprocess returncode
- Agent handle de-duplication and empty message suppression
- Manager drift detection path normalization and PTY state handling

Module mapping:
- `modules.yaml` includes `tui` module mapping under `modules`

Doc maintenance:
- Implementation doc references normalized to avoid broken-link false positives
- Manager startup reference uses `.ngram/CLAUDE.md`

Archived detail:
- Historical feature list, handoffs, and observations moved to `docs/tui/archive/SYNC_archive_2024-12.md`

---

## IN PROGRESS

- Queue management for >3 issues in repair

---

## PLANNED FEATURES (HIGH LEVEL)

- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Auto-refresh SYNC display on file change
- `/repair --max N` configurable concurrency
- Tab layout for >3 agents

---

## KNOWN GAPS

- Tab layout for >3 agents not fully implemented
- Agent queue processing (issues beyond first 3) not implemented

---

## AGENT OBSERVATIONS

### Remarks
- Large sync content archived to keep module docs within size targets.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Keep doctor-ignore and SYNC notes updated together to avoid drift.

### Propositions
- None
