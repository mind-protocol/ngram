## SUMMARY

Textual-based TUI with a component layout: `NgramApp` composes widgets, `ngram/tui/commands.py` dispatches slash commands, and `ngram/repair_core.py` spawns agents. The UI is a presentation layer over shared CLI logic.

---

## QUICK STRUCTURE (Top-Level)

```
ngram/tui/app.py            # Main Textual app
ngram/tui/app_core.py       # Main Textual app implementation
ngram/tui/commands.py       # Slash command routing
ngram/tui/commands_agent.py # Manager subprocess helpers
ngram/tui/state.py          # Session state
ngram/tui/widgets/*         # UI components
ngram/tui/styles/theme.tcss # Theme
```

## ENTRY POINTS

| Entry Point | File:Line | Triggered By |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| `main()` | `ngram/tui/app.py:12` | `ngram` (no args) via `ngram/cli.py` |
| `NgramApp.compose()` | `ngram/tui/app_core.py:106` | Textual mount |
| `InputBar.action_submit()` | `ngram/tui/widgets/input_bar.py:60` | User Enter |

## WHAT TO READ NEXT

- Implementation structure and responsibilities: `docs/tui/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture_Structure.md`

---

## REMAINING WORK

- Tab layout for >3 agents (columns exist; tabs not implemented).
- `/sync` auto-refresh for SYNC panel.
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks.

---

## DECISIONS MADE

- Single `ngram/tui/commands.py` for command handlers, with subprocess logic extracted to `ngram/tui/commands_agent.py`.
- Paper & Parchment theme defined in `ngram/tui/styles/theme.tcss`.
