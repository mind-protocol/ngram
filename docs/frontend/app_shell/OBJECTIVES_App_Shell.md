# OBJECTIVES — App Shell

```
STATUS: DRAFT
CREATED: 2024-02-23
VERIFIED: 2024-02-23 against Initial documentation
```

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)
1. Provide a consistent and responsive user interface for the Next.js application — Ensures a unified and predictable user experience across all frontend routes.
2. Serve as the root for all frontend routes and global application components — Centralizes core UI elements and enables application-wide functionalities.
3. Manage global styles and assets efficiently — Guarantees consistent visual branding and optimal loading performance.

## NON-OBJECTIVES
- Handle business logic for specific features (e.g., Connectome graph interactions) — Delegated to dedicated sub-modules.
- Provide application-specific data fetching or state management beyond global context — Handled by feature-specific modules or data layers.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)
- When custom styling conflicts with standard Next.js/Tailwind patterns, favor standard patterns to maintain consistency and ease of maintenance.
- We accept a slightly larger initial bundle size for global assets to preserve instant page transitions and consistent visual experience.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)
- Fast page load times (LCP < 2.5s)
- Consistent header, footer, and navigation across all routes
- All frontend routes resolve correctly without 404s

## MARKERS

<!-- @ngram:todo
title: "Refine performance metrics for Next.js App Shell"
priority: medium
context: |
  The current success signals are high-level. More specific metrics (e.g., FID, CLS, TTFB) should be defined.
task: |
  Research Next.js performance best practices and define precise, measurable success signals for the App Shell.
-->

<!-- @ngram:proposition
title: "Introduce a global error boundary for the App Shell"
priority: medium
context: |
  Currently, unhandled errors might crash the entire application. A global error boundary would improve resilience.
implications: |
  Adds a new top-level component in `layout.tsx` and requires error handling logic.
suggested_changes: |
  Implement a React Error Boundary component in `layout.tsx` to catch and display UI errors gracefully.
