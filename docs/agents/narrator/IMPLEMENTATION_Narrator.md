### File Responsibilities

| File | Purpose | Key Functions/Classes | Lines | Status |
|------|---------|----------------------|-------|--------|
| `agents/narrator/CLAUDE.md` | Authorial intelligence rules | N/A | ~400 | OK |
| `engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py` | Prompt construction and IO | `run_narrator` | ~300 | OK |
| `engine/infrastructure/orchestration/agent_cli.py` | Subprocess management | `run_agent` | ~200 | OK |

## DESIGN PATTERNS

### Architecture Pattern

**Pattern:** Agent-as-a-Service with CLI integration.

**Why this pattern:** Decouples the authorial logic (prompt-driven) from the game engine (Python-driven). The CLI interface allows for thread persistence and easy testing.

### Code Patterns in Use

| Pattern | Applied To | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Prompt Builder | `engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py` | Dynamically assembles context for the LLM. |
| Streaming | `tools/stream_dialogue.py` | Delivers incremental output to the frontend via SSE. |

---

## SCHEMA

### Narrator Output (JSON)

```yaml
NarratorOutput:
  required:
    - scene: object            # New scene tree or updates
    - time_elapsed: int        # Game minutes passed
  optional:
    - mutations: list          # Graph updates to apply
    - voice_lines: list        # Audio assets to trigger
```

---

## ENTRY POINTS

| Entry Point | File:Line | Triggered By |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| Narrator Call | `engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py:50` | Orchestrator.process_action |

---

## DATA FLOW AND DOCKING (FLOW-BY-FLOW)

### Scene Generation: Action → Narrator → Graph

This flow handles the transition from a player action to a newly authored scene, including any world-state changes (mutations).

```yaml
flow:
  name: scene_generation
  purpose: Author new story beats based on current graph state.
  scope: Action -> LLM -> Graph Mutations -> Scene Response
  steps:
    - id: step_1_context
      description: Orchestrator gathers graph context and world state.
      file: engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py
      function: build_prompt
      input: playthrough_id, player_action
      output: full_prompt_string
      trigger: run_narrator call
      side_effects: none
    - id: step_2_author
      description: Agent authors response using CLAUDE.md rules.
      file: agents/narrator/CLAUDE.md
      function: N/A (Agent Intelligence)
      input: prompt
      output: JSON payload
      trigger: subprocess call
      side_effects: none
    - id: step_3_apply
      description: Extract and apply graph mutations from output.
      file: engine/physics/graph/graph_ops.py
      function: apply_mutation
      input: mutation_list
      output: success_boolean
      trigger: engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py parsing
      side_effects: graph state changed
  docking_points:
    guidance:
      include_when: narrative intent becomes concrete data
    available:
      - id: narrator_input
        type: custom
        direction: input
        file: engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py
        function: run_narrator
        trigger: Orchestrator
        payload: PromptContext
        async_hook: optional
        needs: none
        notes: Context fed to the authorial intelligence
      - id: narrator_output
        type: custom
        direction: output
        file: engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py
        function: run_narrator
        trigger: return response
        payload: NarratorOutput
        async_hook: required
        needs: none
        notes: Raw output before filtering
    health_recommended:
      - dock_id: narrator_output
        reason: Verification of authorial coherence and schema adherence.

## LOGIC CHAINS

### LC1: Invention to Canon

**Purpose:** Ensure LLM inventions are persisted correctly.

```
Agent authored "fact"
  → engine/infrastructure/orchestration/narrator.py extracts mutations
    → graph_ops.py applies to FalkorDB
      → fact is now queryable by physics/other agents
```
