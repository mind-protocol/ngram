## Injection Interface

The Runner returns a structured **Injection** for the Narrator.

## BEHAVIORS

- Reads graph state, advances time, and emits a structured Injection that
  mirrors actual graph mutations and detected flips.
- Interrupts immediately when a player-affecting flip occurs, returning the
  event payload and remaining minutes for a resume call.
- Completes cleanly when time elapses without player-facing flips, returning
  world changes and news for narration context.
- Emits low-urgency beats to the injection queue without interrupting the
  current scene, keeping narration flow smooth.

## INPUTS / OUTPUTS

Inputs come from the orchestrator (action context, elapsed minutes, player
context, and graph state); see `docs/agents/world-runner/INPUT_REFERENCE.md`
for the full contract. Outputs are the Injection payload (plus queued
injections when appropriate) documented in `docs/agents/world-runner/TOOL_REFERENCE.md`.

## OUTPUTS

```typescript
interface Injection {
  interrupted: boolean;
  at_minute?: number;
  remaining?: number;
  event?: Event;

  completed?: boolean;
  time_elapsed?: number;

  world_changes: WorldChange[];
  news_available: News[];
}
```

See `docs/agents/world-runner/TOOL_REFERENCE.md` for canonical schemas.

## BEHAVIORS

- Emits an Injection for every run, marking `interrupted` or `completed`
  explicitly so the Narrator can branch the response.
- Stops on player-affecting flips and returns the triggering `event` payload.
- Applies graph mutations during the run and summarizes them in `world_changes`.
- Packages low-urgency beats as `news_available` for optional narration.

---

## INPUTS / OUTPUTS

**Inputs:**
- Long action intent + expected duration from the Narrator.
- Playthrough context (id, player identity, location, current scene).
- Graph state and tension records queried at tick time.

**Outputs:**
- Injection payload describing interrupt/completion and elapsed time.
- Graph mutations already applied in the engine store.
- Optional queued injections for in-scene beats or reactions.

---

## Interrupted Injection

- Trigger: a flip affects the player.
- Behavior: stop immediately, return `interrupted: true` and `event`.
- Narrator writes the scene, resolves it, then resumes with `remaining` minutes.

---

## Completed Injection

- Trigger: time span ends without a player-facing flip.
- Behavior: return `completed: true`, `time_elapsed`, and any background world changes/news.

---

## Injection Queue (In-Scene Events)

The Runner can append low-urgency events to `playthroughs/{id}/injection_queue.json` for the Narrator to weave into the current scene. These do **not** interrupt. Typical uses: companion actions, reactions, minor scene beats.

---

## Event / WorldChange / News

```typescript
interface Event {
  type: EventType;
  location: string;
  description: string;
  characters: string[];
  narrator_notes?: string;
}

type EventType = 'ambush' | 'encounter' | 'discovery' | 'arrival' | 'message' | 'event';
```

```typescript
interface WorldChange {
  type: WorldChangeType;
  id: string;
  summary?: string;
  pressure?: number;
}

type WorldChangeType =
  | 'narrative_created'
  | 'narrative_updated'
  | 'tension_created'
  | 'tension_resolved'
  | 'tension_pressure_changed'
  | 'character_moved'
  | 'belief_changed';
```

```typescript
interface News {
  summary: string;
  narrative_id?: string;
  source: string;
  reliability: number;
  location_heard?: string;
}
```

## EDGE CASES

- No flips occur during the full duration: returns `completed` with
  `time_elapsed` and empty `world_changes`/`news_available` arrays as needed.
- Multiple flips in a single tick: only the first player-affecting flip
  interrupts; remaining flips become background changes or news.
- Optional fields stay absent rather than populated with placeholders when
  there is no interrupt or completion payload to provide.

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

- Must not invent events or world changes that are not anchored in graph
  mutations produced by the tick loop.
- Must not interrupt for non-player-facing flips; those remain background
  updates or queued injections.
- Must not author narrative prose or override the Narrator’s scene writing.

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

- Should the Injection include a compact trace summary for debugging long
  actions without rehydrating full tick logs?
- Is there a single canonical schema artifact we can link to, rather than
  repeating partial examples across docs?

--- 

## Resume Pattern (Narrator)

```
1. Narrator writes interrupt scene
2. Player responds and resolves
3. Narrator calls Runner with remaining time
4. Runner continues until next interrupt or completion
```

---

## EDGE CASES

- No flips occur: Runner still returns `completed: true` with `time_elapsed`.
- Multiple flips: first player-affecting flip interrupts; later ones wait.
- Empty `world_changes`: Injection still returns structural fields for caller.
- Zero or near-zero duration: may immediately complete with no mutations.

---

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

- Does not author prose or resolve player choices; Narrator owns narration.
- Does not invent non-graph facts; reads and writes through graph APIs only.
- Does not interrupt on non-player-facing flips; those become background news.

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

- Should the Runner attach a concise tick trace for debugging interruptions?
- Is there a canonical JSON schema artifact we can link instead of duplicates?
- How should partial tick progress be represented when resuming mid-action?
