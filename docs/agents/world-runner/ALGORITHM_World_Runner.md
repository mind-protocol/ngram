## OVERVIEW

The World Runner advances time in discrete ticks, inspects tension flips, and
returns an Injection that either interrupts the Narrator (player-impacting
flip) or completes the requested duration with accumulated world changes and
news. The loop is intentionally short-lived and stateless across calls.

---

## DATA STRUCTURES

- **Injection:** Structured response containing interrupt/completion flags,
  elapsed time, remaining time, event payload, world changes, and news items.
- **Flip:** Result of a tick when tension crosses a breaking threshold, with
  location, involved characters, urgency, and references to source tensions.
- **PlayerContext:** Player location/route, companions, and time context used
  by `affects_player` for intersection decisions.
- **WorldChange:** Background mutation records derived from non-player flips.
- **NewsItem:** Propagated summary items for changes that did not interrupt.

---

## Core Principle: Runner Owns the Tick Loop

The Runner advances time in 5-minute ticks, checks for flips, and stops only when the player is affected or time runs out.

---

## ALGORITHM: run_world

```python
def run_world(action, max_minutes, player_context):
    minutes = 0
    world_changes = []
    news = []

    while minutes < max_minutes:
        result = run_graph_tick(elapsed_minutes=5)
        minutes += 5

        for flip in result.flips:
            if affects_player(flip, player_context, minutes):
                event = process_flip_for_player(flip)
                return Injection(
                    interrupted=True,
                    at_minute=minutes,
                    remaining=max_minutes - minutes,
                    event=event,
                    world_changes=world_changes,
                    news_available=news
                )

        for flip in result.flips:
            world_changes.extend(process_flip_background(flip))

        news.extend(propagate_news(minutes))

    return Injection(
        interrupted=False,
        completed=True,
        time_elapsed=max_minutes,
        world_changes=world_changes,
        news_available=news
    )
```

## Player Intersection (`affects_player`)

```python
def affects_player(flip, player_context, current_tick):
    player_loc = player_location_at_tick(player_context, current_tick)

    if flip.location == player_loc:
        return True
    if "char_player" in flip.involved_characters:
        return True
    if any(c in player_context.companions for c in flip.involved_characters):
        return True
    if flip.urgency == "critical" and nearby(flip.location, player_loc):
        return True

    return False
```

## Algorithm Steps (Condensed)

1. **Tick:** Update tension pressure, narrative weight, and decay.
2. **Detect flips:** Tensions over breaking point become flip candidates.
3. **Process flips:**
   - Player-affecting flip → generate `Event` and return interrupted Injection.
   - Non-player flip → create narratives/beliefs/tensions as background changes.
4. **Propagate news:** News spreads based on time and significance.
5. **Return Injection:** Completed or interrupted with world changes and news.

---

## KEY DECISIONS

- **Fixed tick size (5 minutes):** Keeps loop predictable and bounded while
  still allowing timely interrupts for player-facing flips.
- **Early return on player impact:** Prioritizes immediate narrative response
  over accumulating further background changes in the same call.
- **Clustered context cap (~30 nodes):** Limits injection size while preserving
  enough related graph context for the Narrator to write coherently.

---

## DATA FLOW

1. Input action + player context enter `run_world`.
2. Tick calls `run_graph_tick`, producing flips and updated tension state.
3. Player-impacting flips create an `Event` and short-circuit to Injection.
4. Non-player flips create background `WorldChange` mutations and `NewsItem`s.
5. Injection (interrupted or completed) is returned to the Narrator pipeline.

---

## COMPLEXITY

Let **T** be the number of ticks (`max_minutes / 5`), **F** flips per tick, and
**N** news items emitted. The loop is `O(T * (F + N))` in the common case, with
constant-time checks for player intersection per flip. Memory is `O(F + N)`
for accumulated changes within a single call.

---

## HELPER FUNCTIONS

- `run_graph_tick(elapsed_minutes)` handles tension propagation and flip
  detection for a single tick.
- `affects_player(flip, player_context, current_tick)` decides whether a flip
  is player-impacting based on location, companions, and urgency.
- `process_flip_for_player(flip)` builds the event payload for the Injection.
- `process_flip_background(flip)` produces non-interrupting world changes.
- `propagate_news(minutes)` aggregates news items based on elapsed time.

---

## INTERACTIONS

- **GraphQueries/GraphOps:** Tick processing reads current graph state and
  persists background changes derived from flips.
- **Narrator service:** Receives the Injection and turns it into player-facing
  narrative content or summaries.
- **Async injection queue:** World Runner outputs may be serialized for the
  narrator injection pipeline depending on orchestration mode.

---

## Stateless Between Calls

Each call is independent. The graph is the memory.

---

## Cluster Context for Flips

For any flip, return a compact cluster of linked nodes (tension, narratives, key characters, and places). Cap total nodes (~30). This gives the Narrator enough context to write the scene without dumping the full graph.

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

- Should tick size be adaptive for very long actions to reduce runtime while
  preserving interrupt sensitivity?
- News propagation rules are high-level; decide if distance/importance weights
  should be formalized in validation or tests.
- Clarify whether background changes are persisted immediately or batched
  for atomic application after the loop finishes.
