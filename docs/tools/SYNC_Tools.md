## CURRENT STATE

Documented the tools module so utility scripts are tracked in the protocol.
Added systemd user unit templates under `tools/systemd/user/`, a v3 ngrok
config at `tools/ngrok.yml`, and a WSL autostart guide at
`docs/infrastructure/wsl-autostart.md`. Added `.ngram/logs/` plus a
`.ngram/systemd.env` placeholder to wire frontend commands into systemd.
Added `blood-fe.service` to run the `the-blood-ledger` frontend and wired it
into `ngram-stack.target`.
Expanded `docs/tools/VALIDATION_Tools.md` so the validation template now
includes behaviors guaranteed, objectives covered, properties, error
conditions, health coverage, verification procedures, sync status, and gap
analysis narratives that each exceed the 50-character guidance.

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- No frontend start command exists in-repo; `ngram-fe.service` now requires
  `FE_CMD` in `.ngram/systemd.env`.
- `ngram-fe.service` now targets `~/ngram/frontend`; the blood frontend has its
  own unit.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Confirm the exact frontend start command and update
  `.ngram/systemd.env` so `ngram-fe.service` can start cleanly.
- [ ] Confirm the blood frontend port/command once its build is finalized.

### Propositions
- If a canonical frontend repo exists, add a brief doc link here so future
  agents can locate its startup command quickly.

## TODO

- [ ] Add fixtures and run examples for each script to validate outputs.
