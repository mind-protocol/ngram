## BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED

| Behavior ID | Behavior                        | Why This Validation Matters                                |
|-------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| B1          | Renders Connectome Page Shell   | Ensures the Ngram feature correctly delegates its rendering to the Connectome shell, maintaining expected UI continuity. |

---

## OBJECTIVES COVERED

| Objective          | Validations | Rationale                                                                      |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Future Integration | V1          | Confirming proper delegation ensures a stable foundation for future Ngram UI development. |

---

## INVARIANTS

These must ALWAYS be true:

### V1: ConnectomePageShell Rendered

```
When the NgramPage component is rendered, the ConnectomePageShell component must be present in the DOM as its direct child.
```

**Checked by:** Manual visual inspection, or automated UI tests (if available) verifying the presence of ConnectomePageShell-specific elements on the `/ngram` route.

---

## PROPERTIES

N/A - The `NgramPage` component is too simple to have complex properties requiring property-based testing. Its behavior is a direct delegation.

---

## ERROR CONDITIONS

### E1: ConnectomePageShell Import Failure

```
WHEN:    The `ConnectomePageShell` component cannot be imported (e.g., due to file path errors, deletion).
THEN:    The NgramPage component will fail to compile or render, resulting in an application error.
SYMPTOM: A blank page or a runtime error message in the browser console, indicating a module import failure.
```

**Verified by:** Local development server startup (ensures compilation) and navigating to `/ngram` in a browser.

---

## HEALTH COVERAGE

| Invariant | Signal                                | Status          |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| V1        | Presence of `ConnectomePageShell` in DOM | ⚠ NOT YET VERIFIED |

---

## VERIFICATION PROCEDURE

### Manual Checklist

```
[ ] V1 holds — Navigate to the `/ngram` route in the browser and visually confirm that the Connectome UI is displayed.
[ ] All behaviors from BEHAVIORS_Ngram_Feature_Placeholder_Page.md work — Confirm that the page loads without errors and shows the expected Connectome shell.
[ ] All edge cases handled — Verify that if `ConnectomePageShell` is modified or removed, the application correctly reports an error.
[ ] All anti-behaviors prevented — Ensure no Ngram-specific UI elements appear that are not part of `ConnectomePageShell`.
```

### Automated

```bash
# No automated tests are currently defined for the NgramPage due to its placeholder nature.
# Future tests would involve: 
#   - Jest/React Testing Library: To assert that ConnectomePageShell is rendered.
#   - Cypress/Playwright: To perform end-to-end tests for navigation and UI presence.
```

## MARKERS

<!-- @ngram:todo
title: "Implement automated tests for NgramPage rendering"
priority: medium
context: |
  Currently, verification of NgramPage's behavior is manual. Automated tests would provide faster feedback and prevent regressions.
task: |
  Write unit tests (e.g., with React Testing Library) to ensure that `NgramPage` correctly renders the `ConnectomePageShell` and that no unexpected elements are present. Consider end-to-end tests for route navigation.
-->

<!-- @ngram:proposition
title: "Define more specific invariants for Ngram-specific UI"
priority: low
context: |
  As the Ngram feature evolves beyond a placeholder, it will introduce its own UI and logic, necessitating new, more specific validation rules.
implications: |
  This will significantly expand the `VALIDATION` document, requiring new tests and verification procedures.
suggested_changes: |
  Add invariants related to Ngram-specific data display, interaction flows, and error handling as the UI is developed.
-->
