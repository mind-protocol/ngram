## OVERVIEW

This module implements a minimal algorithm focused solely on rendering another predefined React component, `ConnectomePageShell`. Its primary function is to act as a wrapper or a placeholder, effectively deferring all complex rendering logic and state management to the imported component. There are no internal computations, data transformations, or complex decision trees within this module's own algorithm.

---

## OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS

| Objective | Behaviors Supported | Why This Algorithm Matters |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Future Integration | B1: Renders Connectome Page Shell | This minimal algorithm ensures that the Ngram feature can provide a consistent visual experience by reusing the Connectome UI, while avoiding premature implementation of Ngram-specific logic. |

---

## DATA STRUCTURES

### React Component Hierarchy

```
NgramPage (parent/wrapper)
  └── ConnectomePageShell (child/delegated rendering)
      └── ... (ConnectomePageShell's internal components and logic)
```
Description: The `NgramPage` component acts as a root for the `/ngram` route, holding no internal state or complex data structures of its own. It directly renders the `ConnectomePageShell`, thereby adopting its component hierarchy and underlying data flow.

---

## ALGORITHM: `NgramPage()`

### Step 1: Component Definition

The `NgramPage` is defined as a default export functional React component.

### Step 2: Import Dependencies

The `ConnectomePageShell` component is imported from its relative path: `../connectome/components/connectome_page_shell_route_layout_and_control_surface`.

### Step 3: Render Delegation

Within the `NgramPage` component's return statement, the `ConnectomePageShell` is rendered as the sole child element. No additional props are passed from `NgramPage` to `ConnectomePageShell` at this level, indicating a direct, uncustomized delegation.

```jsx
// pseudocode
function NgramPage() {
  return <ConnectomePageShell />;
}
```

---

## KEY DECISIONS

### D1: Direct Delegation

```
IF the Ngram feature is accessed:
    The ConnectomePageShell is rendered directly without modification.
    Why this path: This approach minimizes development effort for the Ngram feature in its current placeholder state, ensuring rapid prototyping and reuse of existing, functional UI. It also clearly signals that Ngram's UI is not yet distinct from Connectome's.
ELSE:
    N/A (there is no alternative path for NgramPage's rendering logic at this time)
```

---

## DATA FLOW

```
User navigates to /ngram
    ↓
NgramPage component invoked
    ↓
ConnectomePageShell component rendered
    ↓
ConnectomePageShell handles its internal data flow and rendering
```

---

## COMPLEXITY

**Time:** O(1) for the `NgramPage` itself (excluding the rendering of `ConnectomePageShell`) — The component performs a constant number of operations: import and return another component.

**Space:** O(1) for the `NgramPage` itself — No significant memory is allocated or managed by the `NgramPage` component itself.

**Bottlenecks:**
- Any performance bottlenecks would reside within the `ConnectomePageShell` component or its dependencies, not in the `NgramPage` itself.

---

## HELPER FUNCTIONS

N/A - The `NgramPage` component does not contain any helper functions of its own; its logic is entirely encapsulated in the direct rendering of `ConnectomePageShell`.

---

## INTERACTIONS

| Module                       | What We Call               | What We Get |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| `connectome_feature_shell` | `ConnectomePageShell` (React Component) | Rendered Connectome UI |

## MARKERS

<!-- @ngram:todo
title: "Replace ConnectomePageShell with Ngram-specific UI"
priority: low
deferred_until: 2025-01-06
context: |
  The NgramPage currently serves as a placeholder, directly rendering the ConnectomePageShell. As the Ngram feature evolves, it will require its own distinct user interface.
task: |
  Develop Ngram-specific UI components and replace the `ConnectomePageShell` import and rendering with the new Ngram UI. This will involve designing and implementing the core layout, navigation, and content areas unique to Ngram.
decision: "2024-12-23: Deferred 2 weeks. CLI-focused work takes priority. Revisit after 2025-01-06."
-->

<!-- @ngram:proposition
title: "Introduce Ngram-specific data fetching or state management"
priority: medium
context: |
  The current NgramPage is purely presentational, delegating all logic to the ConnectomePageShell. Future Ngram features will likely require dedicated data fetching, API interactions, and local state management.
implications: |
  Adding Ngram-specific logic would increase the complexity of this module, moving it beyond a simple wrapper. It would also necessitate new data structures and algorithms.
suggested_changes: |
  Implement React hooks for data fetching, define a local Redux/Zustand store, or integrate with an API client for Ngram-specific data requirements.
