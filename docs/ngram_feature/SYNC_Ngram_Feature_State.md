# SYNC: Ngram Feature State

## Chain
- Upstream: None (Top-level feature)
- Downstream: app/ngram/page.tsx

## 1. Current Status
-   **Module Created:** The `ngram_feature` module has been defined in `modules.yaml`.
-   **Initial Documentation:** `OBJECTIVES_Ngram_Feature.md`, `PATTERNS_Ngram_Feature.md`, and this `SYNC_Ngram_Feature_State.md` have been created.
-   **Code Reference:** `app/ngram/page.tsx` has been identified as the primary source file for this module.

## 2. Decisions
-   **Module Scope:** Decided to create a dedicated module for `app/ngram` despite its current placeholder nature, to clearly delineate feature boundaries for future development, rather than embedding it further into `app_shell` documentation.
-   **Naming:** Named `ngram_feature` for clarity and consistency with other feature modules.

## 3. Open Questions/Next Steps
-   **Feature Implementation:** The core ngram functionality needs to be implemented within this module, replacing or extending the `ConnectomePageShell` usage.
-   **Dependencies:** Identify and document specific dependencies as the feature matures.
-   **Testing:** Develop unit and integration tests for ngram-specific components and logic.
