## BEHAVIORS

### B1: Renders Connectome Page Shell

```
GIVEN:  The user navigates to the /ngram route.
WHEN:   The NgramPage component is rendered.
THEN:   The ConnectomePageShell component is displayed.
AND:    The Ngram feature acts as a visual alias or wrapper for the Connectome feature.
```

---

## OBJECTIVES SERVED

| Behavior ID | Objective | Why It Matters |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| B1          | Future Integration | Provides a clear entry point for future Ngram-specific UI, leveraging existing Connectome UI while Ngram is under development. |

---

## INPUTS / OUTPUTS

### Primary Function: `NgramPage()`

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| N/A       | N/A  | The NgramPage component takes no explicit props. |

**Outputs:**

| Return | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| JSX.Element | React Component | Returns the rendered `ConnectomePageShell` component. |

**Side Effects:**

- The UI of the application updates to display the Connectome feature.
- Indirectly triggers behaviors and side effects defined within the `ConnectomePageShell` and its children.

---

## EDGE CASES

### E1: ConnectomePageShell Not Found

```
GIVEN:  The `ConnectomePageShell` component cannot be resolved or is missing.
THEN:   A runtime error will occur, preventing the NgramPage from rendering.
```

---

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

What should NOT happen:

### A1: NgramPage Displays Ngram-Specific UI Directly

```
GIVEN:   The NgramPage component is rendered.
WHEN:    No explicit Ngram-specific UI components are intended to be rendered directly at this stage.
MUST NOT:  Render UI elements distinct from `ConnectomePageShell` for the `ngram` feature.
INSTEAD:  It should consistently render `ConnectomePageShell` as a placeholder.
```
