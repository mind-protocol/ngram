# ngram Framework — Sync: Current State

```
LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-18
UPDATED_BY: Claude (Opus 4.5 - Repair Agent)
STATUS: CANONICAL
```

## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- 5 principles (architecture, verification, communication, quality, experience)
- 11 VIEWs covering full lifecycle
- CLI with init, validate, prompt, context
- Documentation process with maturity tracking

**What's still being designed:**
- Nothing currently

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- Drift detection (file watching)
- MCP tools
- PyPI publish

---

## CURRENT STATE

Protocol V1 complete and in use. Dogfooding on itself + Blood Ledger.

**What exists:**
- PROTOCOL.md — navigation (what to load, where to update, how to structure docs)
- PRINCIPLES.md — stance (5 principles: architecture, verification, communication, quality, experience)
- 11 VIEWs covering product development lifecycle
- 8 templates for documentation (including TEST)
- CLI package with `init`, `validate`, `prompt`, and `context` commands
- CLAUDE_ADDITION.md with motivation, principles summary, and lifecycle-ordered VIEWs
- Maturity tracking in SYNC (CANONICAL, DESIGNING, PROPOSED, DEPRECATED)
- Documentation process guidance (top-down/bottom-up, pruning cycle)
- Full documentation chain for protocol module (PATTERNS, BEHAVIORS, ALGORITHM, VALIDATION, IMPLEMENTATION, TEST, SYNC)

**Recent changes (2025-12-18):**
- Added IMPLEMENTATION_Protocol_Code_Architecture.md to complete the documentation chain
- Documents file structure, data flows, and how agents traverse the protocol system
- Fixed broken implementation links in IMPLEMENTATION_Protocol_Code_Architecture.md:
  - Updated tree diagrams to use full project-relative paths in tables
  - Converted bare filename references to resolvable paths (e.g., `templates/ngram/PROTOCOL.md`)
  - Removed backticked paths that started with `.` (caused issues with validator path resolution)
- Fixed CLAUDE.md references: Updated all references from `CLAUDE.md` to `.ngram/CLAUDE.md` since file moved from project root to `.ngram/` directory
- AGENTS.md now mirrors .ngram/CLAUDE.md and appends CODEX_SYSTEM_PROMPT_ADDITION.md
- Added doctor-ignore entry for false positive: doctor's `extract_impl_file_refs()` strips leading dots from paths (`.ngram/` becomes `ngram/`), causing false BROKEN_IMPL_LINK errors. Bug tracked in ignore reason.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Your likely VIEW:** VIEW_Test_Write_Tests_And_Verify

**What needs testing:**
1. `pip install -e .` from repo root
2. `ngram init --dir /tmp/test-project`
3. Verify `.ngram/` created with:
   - PROTOCOL.md
   - PRINCIPLES.md (new!)
   - 9 VIEWs in views/
   - 7 templates in templates/
   - state/SYNC_Project_State.md
4. Verify .ngram/CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md created with principles summary

**Key change since last handoff:**
PRINCIPLES.md now exists. Make sure it's copied during init.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
Protocol V1 complete. Added PRINCIPLES.md capturing your working principles (architecture, verification, communication, quality). The protocol now has two core files: PROTOCOL.md for navigation, PRINCIPLES.md for stance.

**What changed:**
- PRINCIPLES.md created with four core stances from your document
- PROTOCOL.md updated to reference PRINCIPLES.md
- CLAUDE_ADDITION.md includes principles summary so agents see them immediately

**Ready for:**
- Testing the package installation
- Using on a real project (Blood Ledger?)

**Decisions made:**
- Principles in separate file (not embedded in PROTOCOL.md) — gives them space, follows "one solution per problem"
- Principles summary in CLAUDE_ADDITION.md — agents see them immediately without extra file load
- PROTOCOL.md references PRINCIPLES.md as "companion" — clear relationship

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Mental state:**
Good. The principles feel right — they're what was missing. PROTOCOL.md was "here's where things are" but didn't say "here's how to be." Now it does.

**Key insight:**
The separation is important. Navigation changes often (new VIEWs, new file types). Principles change rarely (they're foundational). Keeping them separate means principles can be internalized once, protocol referenced repeatedly.

**What I'm uncertain about:**
Whether agents will actually read PRINCIPLES.md or skip it. The summary in CLAUDE_ADDITION.md helps — they see the core ideas immediately. But the full document has the depth.
