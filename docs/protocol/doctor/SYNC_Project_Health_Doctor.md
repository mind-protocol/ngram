LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-21
UPDATED_BY: codex (prompt health integration)
STATUS: CANONICAL
```

## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- CLI command: `ngram doctor`
- Output formats: text, JSON
- Level filtering: --level critical/warning/all
- Configuration via config.yaml
- .gitignore pattern support
- Checks: monolith, undocumented, stale_sync, placeholder, no_docs_ref, incomplete_chain
- Default ignores: node_modules, .next, dist, build, vendor, __pycache__, etc.
- Health score: 0-100
- Doc-link integrity and code-doc delta coupling checks as defined in `docs/cli/prompt/HEALTH_Prompt_Runtime_Verification.md`

**What's documented but not implemented (v2):**
- check_activity_gaps - No SYNC updates in N days
- check_abandoned - Docs started but never completed
- check_vague_names - Files named utils, helpers, misc, etc.
- `--guide` remediation mode
- Markdown output format

## CURRENT STATE

Doctor command implemented and working.

The command provides holistic project health analysis beyond pass/fail validation. Checks for:
- Monolith files (>500 lines by default)
- Undocumented code directories
- Stale SYNC files (>14 days by default)
- Placeholder docs (template markers)
- Missing DOCS: references (info only)
- Incomplete doc chains
- Doc template drift (missing or short sections vs templates)
- Non-standard doc type filenames
- Doc template drift supports escalation tags to capture human questions.
- Doctor now flags resolved escalation markers so they get applied and removed.
- Escaped marker references in BEHAVIORS to avoid triggering escalation scans.
- Special marker detection now includes `@ngram&#58;todo` entries for task triage.
- Doc-link integrity and code-doc delta coupling checks now guard the prompt doc chain and flagged 27 doc-link + 3 code-doc delta warnings (see `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_Health.md`).
 - Implementation docs now explicitly list each doctor, repair, repo-overview, solve, and TUI code path mentioned by the latest doctor scan so the doc-link integrity check can anchor back to this module.
- Incomplete-implementation detection now treats stub-only bodies (pass/return None/NotImplemented) as incomplete while allowing concise return-based helpers.
- Stub-only detection now evaluates every function boundary (including end-of-file) to avoid false positives on short helpers.
- Large doc module threshold increased by 25% (62.5K chars) to reduce noisy warnings for moderately sized modules.

Features:
- Text and JSON output
- Severity filtering (--level)
- .gitignore pattern support
- Configurable thresholds via config.yaml
- Smart default ignores (node_modules, .next, etc.)
- False positive suppression from doc metadata via `@ngram:doctor:CHECK_TYPE_NAME:false_positive` entries under `UPDATED:`.
- Legacy doctor-ignore entries migrated into doc metadata tags.
- Added doc template drift and non-standard doc type checks with deferred/exception tags in doc metadata.

The latest `ngram doctor --format json` run (see `/tmp/doctor_final.json`) reports zero `DOC_LINK_INTEGRITY` and `CODE_DOC_DELTA_COUPLING` issues for the prompt doc chain while still surfacing the pre-existing warnings (monolith limits, undocumented directories, template drift). This verifies that the targeted refactor removed the 27 doc-link and 3 coupling warnings without masking other alerts.

## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

Suggested order based on dependencies:

1. **Configuration loader** — Other checks need thresholds
2. **Project discovery** — Finds files to check
3. **Individual checks** — Start with monolith, undocumented
4. **Aggregation & scoring** — Combine results
5. **Output formatters** — Text first, then JSON
6. **CLI integration** — Wire into click
7. **Guided remediation** — `--guide` flag

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Likely VIEW:** VIEW_Implement

**To implement:**
1. Read ALGORITHM doc for pseudocode
2. Add `doctor` command to cli.py
3. Create `doctor.py` module for checks
4. Follow existing CLI patterns (click decorators, Path handling)

**Key decisions already made:**
- Monolith threshold: 500 lines default
- Stale SYNC threshold: 14 days default
- Score deductions: critical=-10, warning=-3, info=-1

**Watch out for:**
- Don't count lines in binary files
- Handle permission errors gracefully
- Sort file traversal for determinism

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Summary:** Doctor command fully designed. Docs specify checks, output format, configuration, and testing approach. Ready for implementation.

**Decisions to review:**
- Threshold defaults (500 lines, 14 days) — adjust?
- Severity assignments — anything miscategorized?
- Missing checks — anything else worth detecting?

## TODO

### Immediate

- [x] Expand `docs/protocol/doctor/IMPLEMENTATION_Project_Health_Doctor.md` so it explicitly mentions `ngram/doctor.py` and the doctor checks modules, restoring the bidirectional link for the doc-link warnings.
- [x] Add IMPL references for `ngram/repair_*`, `ngram/repo_overview*`, `ngram/solve_escalations.py`, and the flagged `ngram/tui/*` files inside the relevant CLI implementation docs so their doc-link issues clear.
- [x] Update `docs/protocol/doctor/SYNC_Project_Health_Doctor.md` and `docs/cli/prompt/SYNC_Prompt_Command_State.md` with the latest code changes so the `CODE_DOC_DELTA_COUPLING` warnings disappear after rerunning `ngram doctor` (verified by `ngram doctor --format json` showing zero doc-link/coupling issues).

### Implemented (v1)

- [x] Configuration loader (config.yaml support)
- [x] Project discovery functions
- [x] check_monolith
- [x] check_undocumented
- [x] check_stale_sync
- [x] check_placeholder_docs
- [x] check_no_docs_ref
- [x] check_incomplete_chain
- [x] Result aggregation
- [x] Score calculation
- [x] Text output formatter
- [x] JSON output formatter
- [x] CLI command integration
- [x] Auto-save to HEALTH.md
- [x] prompt_doc_reference_check, prompt_view_table_check, prompt_checklist_presence_check
- [x] doc_link_integrity
- [x] code_doc_delta_coupling

### To Implement (v2)

- [ ] check_activity_gaps - No SYNC updates in N days across project
- [ ] check_abandoned - Docs started but never completed
- [ ] check_vague_names - Files named utils, helpers, misc, etc.
- [ ] `--guide` remediation mode

### Future Ideas

- IDEA: `--fix` mode that auto-creates missing docs
- IDEA: `--watch` mode for continuous health monitoring
- IDEA: Health score badge for README
- IDEA: Integration with CI (GitHub Actions template)
- IDEA: Trend tracking (score over time)

## GAPS

- Completed: Reviewed `BEHAVIORS_Project_Health_Doctor.md` and module SYNC for escalation/conflict markers.
- Remaining: No conflicts or escalation markers found to resolve for this module.
- Blocker: Repair task references a decisionless escalation; needs confirmation of the intended conflict or missing marker.
- Observation: The latest `ngram doctor` run reports zero doc-link integrity or code-doc delta coupling issues for the prompt/doc refactor; splitting `ngram/doctor_checks.py` into dedicated core/reference/stub/metadata/prompt-integrity modules also resolved the monolith warning while the remaining alerts now stem from template drift and metadata gaps.
