## OBJECTIVE

The `ngram_cli_core` module aims to provide the foundational command-line interface (CLI) and essential utilities that power the `ngram` framework. Its primary objectives include:

1.  **Facilitate Agent Interaction:** Enable seamless interaction with AI agents by providing commands for task initiation, monitoring, and repair.
2.  **Ensure Project Health:** Offer robust diagnostic and validation tools (e.g., `doctor`, `validate`) to maintain the consistency and integrity of the project's codebase and documentation.
3.  **Manage Project Context:** Abstract and manage the operational context for various `ngram` commands, ensuring consistent environment and configuration handling.
4.  **Support Repair Workflows:** Implement mechanisms for automated and interactive code repair, guiding agents through the repair pipeline.
5.  **Generate Documentation and Overviews:** Provide tools for generating project overviews and maintaining documentation links.

## CONSTRAINTS

*   **Performance:** CLI commands should execute efficiently without undue latency.
*   **Extensibility:** The core should be designed to easily integrate new commands, checks, and repair strategies.
*   **Robustness:** Commands must handle unexpected inputs and system states gracefully, providing clear error messages.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent user experience and internal API across all CLI commands.

## MEASUREMENT

*   **Test Coverage:** High unit and integration test coverage for core utilities and command logic.
*   **Reliability:** Low incidence of CLI crashes or incorrect behavior reported during operation.
*   **Usability:** Positive feedback from users regarding command clarity and effectiveness.
