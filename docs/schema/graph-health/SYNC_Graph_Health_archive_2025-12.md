## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-19: Restored missing SYNC sections

- **What:** Added IN PROGRESS, KNOWN ISSUES, HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN, and
  CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE sections to match the SYNC template.
- **Why:** Resolve doc-template drift for the graph health module sync doc.
- **Files:** `docs/schema/graph-health/SYNC_Graph_Health.md`
- **Struggles/Insights:** Kept the update documentation-only, no code changes.

### 2025-12-19: Expanded patterns template sections

- **What:** Lengthened inspirations and non-scope notes in the graph health
  patterns doc to meet template guidance.
- **Why:** The doc template drift check flagged short sections for the patterns
  file; expansion keeps the module description complete.
- **Files:** `docs/schema/graph-health/PATTERNS_Graph_Health_Validation.md`
- **Struggles/Insights:** Kept the change purely descriptive; no behavior edits.

### 2025-12-19: Filled graph health patterns scope

- **What:** Added the missing SCOPE section and expanded short gaps entries.
- **Why:** Resolve doc-template drift for the graph health PATTERNS file.
- **Files:** `docs/schema/graph-health/PATTERNS_Graph_Health_Validation.md`,
  `docs/schema/graph-health/SYNC_Graph_Health.md`
- **Struggles/Insights:** Kept scope limited to validation and query artifacts.

### 2025-12-19: Documented graph health module

- **What:** Added PATTERNS + SYNC docs and mapped the module in `modules.yaml`.
- **Why:** The health tooling was undocumented; repairs require a doc chain.
- **Files:** `docs/schema/graph-health/PATTERNS_Graph_Health_Validation.md`,
  `docs/schema/graph-health/SYNC_Graph_Health.md`, `modules.yaml`,
  `engine/graph/health/check_health.py`
- **Struggles/Insights:** Kept docs minimal to avoid duplicating schema docs.

### 2025-12-19: Verified health report helpers

- **What:** Confirmed `HealthReport` helpers (`add_issue`, `error_count`,
  `warning_count`, `is_healthy`) and `load_schema` are fully implemented.
- **Why:** Repair task flagged incomplete functions; code already matches intent.
- **Files:** `engine/graph/health/check_health.py`
- **Struggles/Insights:** No code changes required; repair marked as verified.

### 2025-12-19: Revalidated health check helper implementations

- **What:** Rechecked the health report helpers and `load_schema`; all remain
  implemented with no empty stubs.
- **Why:** Current repair task flagged incomplete implementations again.
- **Files:** `engine/graph/health/check_health.py`,
  `docs/schema/graph-health/SYNC_Graph_Health.md`
- **Struggles/Insights:** No code changes required; recorded verification.

### 2025-12-19: Reconfirmed health check helpers for repair 00

- **What:** Verified `HealthReport` helpers (`add_issue`, `error_count`,
  `warning_count`, `is_healthy`) and `load_schema` are implemented; no code
  changes needed.
- **Why:** Repair task re-flagged these functions as incomplete.
- **Files:** `engine/graph/health/check_health.py`,
  `docs/schema/graph-health/SYNC_Graph_Health.md`
- **Struggles/Insights:** Repair was stale; logged verification only.

### 2025-12-19: Rechecked health check helper implementations

- **What:** Re-reviewed `HealthReport` helpers and `load_schema`; no empty stubs
  found.
- **Why:** Current repair task again flagged incomplete implementations.
- **Files:** `engine/graph/health/check_health.py`,
  `docs/schema/graph-health/SYNC_Graph_Health.md`
- **Struggles/Insights:** No code change required; repair remains stale.

### 2025-12-19: Revalidated health check helpers for repair 00

- **What:** Confirmed `HealthReport` helpers and `load_schema` are implemented;
  no code changes needed.
- **Why:** Repair task flagged incomplete implementations again.
- **Files:** `engine/graph/health/check_health.py`,
  `docs/schema/graph-health/SYNC_Graph_Health.md`
- **Struggles/Insights:** No code changes required; updated SYNC only.
