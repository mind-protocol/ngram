# Physics — Current State

```
STATUS: CANONICAL
UPDATED: 2025-12-20
```

## MATURITY

STATUS: CANONICAL. The physics module behavior is stable and documented. 
Core implementation exists for:
- Physics Tick (`engine/physics/tick.py`)
- Graph Ops/Queries
- Canon Holder (`engine/infrastructure/canon/canon_holder.py` - Core logic built, integration pending)

Still pending:
- Character Handlers (`engine/handlers/`)
- Speed Controller (`engine/infrastructure/orchestration/speed.py`)

## CURRENT STATE

Physics documentation is consolidated in `docs/physics/`, the algorithm is canonical. Implementation exists for core tick + graph ops and the base Canon Holder. Runtime integration with the Orchestrator and specific character handlers are planned but not yet built.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-20: Attention split + interrupt patterns added

- **What:** Added attention split and interrupt-by-focus patterns plus behaviors under `docs/physics/attention/`.
- **Why:** Lock interrupt semantics as focus reconfiguration rather than heuristics.
- **Impact:** Documentation only; no runtime changes.

### 2025-12-20: Attention split validation added

- **What:** Added `VALIDATION_Attention_Split_And_Interrupts.md` under `docs/physics/attention/`.
- **Why:** Centralize attention/interrupt invariants with their patterns.
- **Impact:** Documentation only; no runtime changes.

### 2025-12-20: Physics mechanisms doc added

- **What:** Added `ALGORITHM_Physics_Mechanisms.md` to enumerate concrete mechanisms with code references.
- **Why:** Provide a precise, function-level map of energy/pressure/surfacing mechanics.
- **Impact:** Documentation only; no runtime changes.

### 2025-12-21: Physics mechanisms doc relocated to algorithms

- **What:** Moved `ALGORITHM_Physics_Mechanisms.md` into `docs/physics/algorithms/` and refreshed CHAIN/POINTERS so every physics doc links to the canonical mechanism map in the algorithms subfolder.
- **Why:** Squashed the duplicate ALGORITHM doc warning by keeping specialized mechanism docs in the algorithms folder while leaving `ALGORITHM_Physics.md` as the physics root overview.
- **Impact:** Documentation only; the root physics directory now hosts a single ALGORITHM doc while mechanism-level detail lives under `algorithms/`.

### 2025-12-20: Pending external implementation references

- **What:** Replaced stub file paths with pending import notes in implementation docs.
- **Why:** Remove broken impl links until upstream code is imported.

### 2025-12-20: Physics tick energy helpers verified

- **What:** Verified `_flow_energy_to_narratives`, `_propagate_energy`, `_decay_energy`, and `_update_narrative_weights` in `engine/physics/tick.py` already contain concrete implementations.
- **Why:** Repair #16 flagged these helpers as empty; confirmed they are implemented and align with the physics algorithm.
- **Impact:** No code changes required; verification recorded to prevent repeat repairs.
- **Repair run:** `18-INCOMPLETE_IMPL-physics-tick`.

### 2025-12-20: Ngram Framework Refactor

- **What:** Refactored `IMPLEMENTATION_Physics.md` and renamed `TEST_Physics.md` to its new format (Health content).
- **Why:** To align with the new ngram documentation standards and emphasize DATA FLOW AND DOCKING.
- **Impact:** Physics module documentation is now compliant with the latest protocol; Health checks are anchored to concrete docking points.

## GAPS

- [ ] Automated check for "The Snap" transition display rules.
- [ ] Real-time monitoring of energy levels across large graph clusters.

## KNOWN ISSUES

`ngram validate` still reports pre-existing doc gaps and broken CHAIN links in other modules; no physics-specific defects are currently open.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

If you touch physics code, use VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code and update this SYNC plus any impacted doc chain entries (ALGORITHM/IMPLEMENTATION/TEST).

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

Physics documentation is aligned and no behavior changes were made; the only remaining work is optional implementation of planned handlers/canon/speed.

## TODO

- [ ] Create `engine/handlers/` and wire flip-triggered handler dispatch.
- [ ] Implement canon holder and speed controller runtime scaffolding.

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

Focus stayed on doc-template alignment with minimal scope; no code paths were changed, so confidence is high in the consistency of this sync update.
Attention documentation now uses a single PATTERNS file—interrupt semantics were merged into `PATTERNS_Attention_Energy_Split.md` and the redundant doc was removed to keep the chain canonical.

## POINTERS

- `docs/physics/ALGORITHM_Physics.md` for the canonical physics mechanics.
- `docs/physics/algorithms/ALGORITHM_Physics_Mechanisms.md` for mechanism-level mapping to code.
- `docs/physics/IMPLEMENTATION_Physics.md` for current code entry points.
- `docs/physics/attention/PATTERNS_Attention_Energy_Split.md` for attention split invariants and focus reconfiguration interrupts.
- `docs/physics/attention/VALIDATION_Attention_Split_And_Interrupts.md` for attention/interrupt validations.

## Handoff Notes

- v2 architecture is fully documented in ALGORITHM files.
- **ALGORITHM_Physics.md** is the master document.
- **Weight vs Energy**: All nodes have both weight (importance over time, slow) and energy (current activation, fast).
- **Salience = weight × energy** — determines surfacing (threshold = 0.3).
- Tension is computed from structure, not stored.
- **Energy IS proximity** — no separate proximity calculation.
