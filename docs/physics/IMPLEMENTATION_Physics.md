### File Responsibilities

| File | Purpose | Key Functions/Classes | Lines | Status |
|------|---------|----------------------|-------|--------|
| `engine/physics/tick.py` | Living world simulation | `GraphTick.run()`, `_detect_flips` | ~450 | WATCH |
| `engine/physics/graph/graph_queries.py` | Graph read operations | `GraphQueries` | ~892 | SPLIT |
| `engine/physics/graph/graph_ops.py` | Graph write operations | `GraphOps` | ~792 | SPLIT |
| `engine/moment_graph/traversal.py` | Interaction traversal | `handle_click` | ~300 | OK |

**Size Thresholds:**
- **OK** (<400 lines): Healthy size, easy to understand
- **WATCH** (400-700 lines): Getting large, consider extraction opportunities
- **SPLIT** (>700 lines): Too large, must split before adding more code

## DESIGN PATTERNS

### Architecture Pattern

**Pattern:** Graph-first orchestration with a thin coordinator layer.

**Why this pattern:** Physics logic stays in the graph and tick loop while the orchestrator only sequences calls and never owns narrative state. This keeps storage authoritative and prevents split-brain behavior between runtime services and the graph.

### Code Patterns in Use

| Pattern | Applied To | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Facade | `engine/physics/graph/graph_ops.py` | Provide a single, stable write entry point to graph mutations. |
| Mixins | graph_ops_* mixins in `engine/physics/graph/` | Keep domain-specific mutations isolated while composing them into GraphOps. |
| Observer | `engine/physics/graph/graph_ops_events.py` | Emit mutation events for downstream listeners. |
| Query/Command split | `engine/physics/graph/graph_queries.py` vs `engine/physics/graph/graph_ops.py` | Separate read paths from write paths. |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Stateful orchestration**: Avoid caching graph state in orchestrator memory -> always query the graph.
- **Hidden writes in queries**: Keep writes in graph_ops so effects stay explicit.

## DATA FLOW AND DOCKING (FLOW-BY-FLOW)

### Physics Tick Flow: Living World Metabolism

The core metabolism of the world. Energy flows from characters to narratives to moments, eventually triggering "flips" that become observable events.

```yaml
flow:
  name: physics_tick
  purpose: Propagate energy and detect narrative flips.
  scope: Character energy -> Narrative energy -> Moment weight -> Flip detection
  steps:
    - id: step_1_inject
      description: Characters pump energy into narratives they believe in.
      file: engine/physics/tick.py
      function: _flow_energy_to_narratives
      input: char_energies (Dict)
      output: narrative_energies (Dict)
      trigger: GraphTick.run()
      side_effects: none
    - id: step_2_propagate
      description: Energy flows between narratives via RELATES_TO links.
      file: engine/physics/tick.py
      function: _propagate_energy
      input: narrative_energies (Dict)
      output: narrative_energies (Dict)
      trigger: GraphTick.run()
      side_effects: none
    - id: step_3_detect
      description: Check if any tension/moment crosses breaking threshold.
      file: engine/physics/tick.py
      function: _detect_flips
      input: tensions (List)
      output: flips (List)
      trigger: GraphTick.run()
      side_effects: none
  docking_points:
    guidance:
      include_when: energy crosses a boundary or flips are detected
    available:
      - id: tick_input
        type: custom
        direction: input
        file: engine/physics/tick.py
        function: run
        trigger: Orchestrator.tick
        payload: elapsed_minutes
        async_hook: not_applicable
        needs: none
        notes: Entry point for the physics metabolism
      - id: flip_output
        type: event
        direction: output
        file: engine/physics/tick.py
        function: run
        trigger: return flips
        payload: List[FlipResult]
        async_hook: required
        needs: none
        notes: Critical for narrator/handler triggering
    health_recommended:
      - dock_id: flip_output
        reason: Verification of narrative momentum and event generation.
```

## LOGIC CHAINS

### LC1: Flip Detection

**Purpose:** Determine when a moment should trigger a handler.

```
moment.weight (via narrative.energy)
  → engine/physics/tick.py:_detect_flips()    # Check against breaking_point
    → TickResult.flips                        # Surface to orchestrator
      → Orchestrator.dispatch()                # Trigger character handlers
```

**Data transformation:**
- Input: `float` (pressure/weight) — Current system state
- Threshold check: `pressure >= breaking_point`
- Output: `List[Dict]` — Metadata for event generation

## RUNTIME PATTERNS (Infrastructure)

### Scene as Query
There is no scene object. "Scene" is a query result of `Character AT Place`.

### Time Passage
Conversations have opportunity cost. `advance_time(minutes)` is called on every spoken moment, triggering physics ticks.

### Character Movement
Travel is a `Moment` with an `action: travel` field. Processing this updates the `AT` link in the graph.
