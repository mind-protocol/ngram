## BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED

| Behavior ID | Behavior | Why This Validation Matters |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| B1 | Ledger remains append-only within each session so entries never shrink or rewrite once committed, even as new steps arrive. | Prevents exported logs, replay tooling, and telemetry panels from seeing phantom edits and keeps explanations aligned with the recorded timeline. |
| B2 | The active focus data holds only one node_id or edge_id at a time (or null), never presenting parallel actives unless an explicit focus-shift flow is invoked. | Keeps UI indicators, narration, and automation heuristics consistent by ensuring no contradictory focus states escape validation. |
| B3 | Each step commit appends to the ledger, updates focus, and refreshes explanation together so no intermediate state leaks to listeners. | Guarantees subscribers never observe mid-commit partial data and lets tooling treat the triple update as a single atomic contract. |
| B4 | Wait timer metrics clamp elapsed seconds to [0, 4.0], record a started_at_ms that is <= now_ms, and display progress with one decimal precision. | Ensures countdown widgets and diagnostics never report negative periods or overly granular precision, keeping timer behavior predictable for humans and tests. |

## OBJECTIVES COVERED

| Objective | Validations | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Preserve ledger integrity while keeping exports faithful to the current store contents. | V1, P1 | Confirming append-only ledger behavior plus export equality prevents downstream tooling from replaying altered histories and gives humans confidence in the recorded evidence. |
| Enforce single-focus plus atomic commits so concurrent UI actors cannot see conflicting active targets. | V2, V3 | Keeping the single-active-focus and atomic commit invariants together defends against flashes of inconsistent UI state and prevents action sequencing bugs. |
| Clamp and present wait timer data so pacing guarantees match the human-facing countdown meters. | V4 | Limiting timer progress to the documented bounds and precision keeps experience pacing stable and ensures diagnostics catch drift before sessions rely on faulty timing. |

## INVARIANTS

### V1: Ledger is append-only within a session

```
Within a session_id:
ledger length never decreases
past entries are never mutated
```

### V2: Exactly one active focus

```
active_focus.active_node_id is one value or null
active_focus.active_edge_id is one value or null
No parallel “active set” unless explicitly designed
```

### V3: Atomic commit integrity

```
For each step release commit:
ledger appended AND focus updated AND explanation updated occur in the same commit
No observable intermediate state should exist
```

### V4: Wait timer boundaries are correct

```
If wait_progress.started_at_ms is set:
started_at_ms <= now_ms
Elapsed seconds are clamped to [0, 4.0]
Display uses 1 decimal precision
```

---

## PROPERTIES

### P1: Export equals ledger

```
Copy/export output must equal store.ledger (1:1) plus optional formatting metadata
```

### P2: Restart resets state consistently with selected policy

```
After restart:
cursor == 0
focus cleared
timers reset
session_id changes
and ledger behavior matches chosen policy (clear vs boundary)
```

---

## ERROR CONDITIONS

### E1: Focus mismatch

* symptom: multiple nodes/edges appear active simultaneously due to store state
* severity: ERROR

### E2: Ledger mutation

* symptom: existing ledger event changes after append
* severity: ERROR

## VERIFICATION PROCEDURE

### Manual Checklist

```
[ ] Click Next once → log + focus + explanation change together
[ ] Click Next again → previous entry unchanged, ledger grows by 1
[ ] Click Restart → session_id changes, cursor=0, focus cleared
[ ] Trigger wait timer start/stop → progress clamps to 4.0s and shows 1 decimal
[ ] Copy log → export equals visible ledger count
```

### Automated

```
pnpm connectome:health state_store
```

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: do we need a “transaction id” recorded per commit for debugging atomicity? (nice-to-have)
* IDEA: ledger entries can include `arrival_index` to guarantee ordering even with same timestamp
