## OBJECTIVES SERVED

- Keep every observable step release grounded in a single deterministic action so log exports, UI highlights, and telemetry watchers all reference the same event ids and nothing is derived from component-local state.
- Ensure focus, timer, and tick signals always flow through the store so consumer panels read a single source of truth for cursor highlights, wait progress bars, cron fills, and health indicators instead of inventing their own clocks.
- Provide a consistent exportable ledger snapshot, singular active focus, and deterministic timer story so downstream health checks and telemetry adapters can assert atomicity without replaying UI behavior.

## BEHAVIORS

### B1: “One step” feels atomic everywhere

```
GIVEN:  a step is released
WHEN:   the store updates
THEN:   the diagram highlight, explanation sentence, and log entry change together
AND:    there is no intermediate state where the highlight changed but the log did not (or vice versa)
AND:    this atomic window lets telemetry and health observers rely on the same release commit for every rendered highlight.
```

### B2: The ledger is always copyable and truthful

```
GIVEN:  the user presses “Copy log”
THEN:   the exported data is exactly the ledger entries in the store
AND:    the export includes stable ids and required fields (per event_model)
AND:    downstream agents can map every copied entry back into the store because the ids and payloads never diverge mid-export.
```

### B3: Focus is singular and persistent

```
GIVEN:  a step is released
THEN:   there is exactly one active edge and one active node focus
AND:    they remain active until the next release
AND:    singular focus means health checks can assert focus invariants without chasing drifting component timers.
```

### B4: Wait progress bar behaves like time-under-load, not animation

```
GIVEN:  a player message is “sent”
WHEN:   no answer has arrived yet
THEN:   wait progress increases up to max 4.0s
AND:    when the answer arrives, progress stops and resets (or marks completion)
AND:    the timing story is carried by the store so wait bars always represent the real elapsed delay, even when the renderer is paused.
```

### B5: Tick cron display is consistent with speed selection

```
GIVEN:  speed is set to pause/1x/2x/3x
THEN:   store updates nominal tick interval and tick display label
AND:    the cron node fill reflects the interval (signal only; rendering owns animation)
AND:    speed changes immediately adjust the stored tick signal so cron fills, logs, and health monitors stay aligned.
```

---

## EDGE CASES

### E1: Rapid Next clicking

```
GIVEN:  user clicks Next rapidly
THEN:   store commits remain ordered and consistent (no lost steps)
AND:    the ordered action stream keeps telemetry loggers from replaying partial transitions after the player spams Next.
```

This deterministic queue keeps telemetry loggers and replay tools aligned with every release event even under fast click bursts.

### E2: Out-of-order realtime events (deferred)

```
GIVEN:  two realtime events arrive out of order
THEN:   store preserves a stable ordering policy (arrival order or at_ms policy)
AND:    UI remains readable
AND:    the ordering policy documented in the store keeps renderers sane even when telemetry batches arrive with jitter.
```

This ordering contract keeps the UI timeline readable when telemetry arrival order drifts, so health monitors can still validate their invariants.

---

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

### A1: Component-local shadow ledger

```
MUST NOT: maintain a separate log list in a component
AND:         the store’s ledger is the only source for copy/export, so local shadow ledgers would immediately diverge from canonical history.
INSTEAD: log is derived exclusively from store.ledger
```

Local copies would drift from canonical exports, so renderers must derive logs exclusively through selectors that read `store.ledger`.

### A2: Focus ambiguity

```
MUST NOT: multiple active edges remain lit simultaneously (unless explicitly allowed)
AND:         focus ambiguity would break health stories that assert exactly one edge/node pair is active per release.
INSTEAD: store.active_focus is singular
```

`store.active_focus` remains the single focus source, so inference-based highlight kits cannot introduce ambiguity or double-lit edges.

---

## INPUTS / OUTPUTS

Store is a state authority; it does not return values except selectors.

**Inputs (actions):** explicit store actions (see PATTERNS).
**Outputs:** updated state; selectors for UI.

Documenting these inputs/outputs clarifies that the store never returns derived payloads and that renderers must read selectors instead of asking the store for values directly.

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: Should focus include “active_zone_id” (FE/BE/GRAPH/AGENTS) to improve zone highlighting?
* IDEA: Include a “session_id” so exports clearly separate restarts.
