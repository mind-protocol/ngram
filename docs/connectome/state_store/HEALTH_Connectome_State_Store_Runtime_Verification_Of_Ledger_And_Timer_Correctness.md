# state_store — Health: Verification Mechanics and Coverage

STATUS: DRAFT
CREATED: 2025-12-20

---

## PURPOSE OF THIS FILE

This HEALTH file ensures that the Connectome state_store keeps the ledger, focus, timers, explanations, and export pipeline coherent during human or telemetry-driven interactions so agents can trust the runtime despite rapid clicking, telemetry surges, or manual restarts. It limits verification to runtime docking hooks and explicitly defers rendering aesthetics, backend ingestion correctness, or upstream architecture changes to their own health documentation.

## WHY THIS PATTERN

The HEALTH pattern is appropriate here because the state_store needs a lightweight, throttled instrumentation layer that checks runtime invariants without mutating implementation code. By anchoring every check to VALIDATION invariants and the docking points already exposed by the state flows, this pattern catches issues that unit tests or static analysis miss while keeping the checks close to the live experience.

## HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

1. Read the OBJECTIVES → BEHAVIORS → PATTERNS → ALGORITHM → VALIDATION → IMPLEMENTATION → SYNC chain so you understand what the module is supposed to do before designing indicators.
2. Inspect the implementation entry points inside `app/connectome/lib` and the long-named actions so you can map triggers to the docking points listed below.
3. Determine which signals matter most (ledger append, singular focus, timer precision, export fidelity, restart policy) and make sure each indicator references the relevant VALIDATION ID.
4. For every flow, bind a health indicator to a docking event or metric and verify the input/output pair against the validation criteria.
5. Keep throttling low and forward results only to the ngram health stream so we do not overwhelm the Connectome UI.
6. After adjusting the indicators, update this document, the module SYNC, and rerun `ngram validate`.

## FLOWS ANALYSIS (TRIGGERS + FREQUENCY)

```
flows_analysis:

* flow_id: store_stepper_atomic_commit
  purpose: Keep the ledger, focus, explanation, and wait/tick timers consistent so UI and exports never witness a partial release.
  triggers:
    - type: manual
      source: runtime_engine Next button handler inside `app/connectome/page_shell`
  frequency:
    expected_rate: "Human-driven releases ~1 per 5 seconds during a calm session."
    peak_rate: "Rapid Next clicking bursts reaching 5 commits in 2 seconds."
    burst_behavior: "Pending UI events queue while the atomic commit drains them one at a time."
  risks:
  - "partial commits leave ledger/focus/explanation out of sync (VALIDATION V3)"
  - "ledger order corruption when FlowEvents replay out of order with identical timestamps (VALIDATION V1)"
  - "parallel active focus radiates if focus update is not bound to the same commit (VALIDATION V2)"
  notes: "Atomic commit docking points are the anchor for every health indicator so we guard them with high priority."

* flow_id: store_wait_timer_progress
  purpose: Validate that the wait progress bar and tick display stay within 0-4 seconds at one decimal precision so the player-facing UI reflects real time.
  triggers:
    - type: event
      source: runtime_engine wait timer start/stop helpers in `connectome_wait_timer_progress_and_tick_display_signal_selectors`
  frequency:
    expected_rate: "Approximately 1 per player message (roughly once per minute)."
    peak_rate: "Burst of 5 wait timer updates within ten seconds during fast-paced play."
    burst_behavior: "Selectors reuse the same state slice so timer recalculations happen in lockstep with the ledger commit."
  risks:
  - "timer drift beyond the 4.0s clamp or precision drops to >0.1s (VALIDATION V4)"
  notes: "Timer integrity is driven by the commit action so we use the same docking telemetry to confirm the displayed progress."

* flow_id: store_realtime_ingestion_append_and_retention
  purpose: Keep telemetry-driven appends honest while retention logic trims excess entries so the ledger stays append-only and focus remains singular.
  triggers:
    - type: event
      source: telemetry_adapter → event_model normalization pipeline that feeds the store
  frequency:
    expected_rate: "Realtime telemetry averages 2 events per minute in steady-state."
    peak_rate: "Debug telemetry storms deliver 20 events per minute."
    burst_behavior: "Retention logic fires when thresholds exceed `RETENTION_MAX_EVENTS`, ensuring we do not spill over memory."
  risks:
  - "retention logic removes the wrong entries, breaking V1 and V2."
  - "focus refresh beats the pinned flag because telemetry updates bypass the normal flow (VALIDATION V2)."
  notes: "This flow documents the retention/docking path so future experiments know which telemetry sources inform the health checks."

* flow_id: store_restart_session_clear_or_boundary
  purpose: Assert that manual restarts and runtime boundary policies emit the expected `session_id` rotation, cursor reset, and focus/timer clear operations tied to the configured policy.
  triggers:
    - type: manual
      source: user Restart button or the runtime boundary controller in `connectome_session_boundary_and_restart_policy_controller`
  frequency:
    expected_rate: "Audience-level restart actions occur less than once per minute."
    peak_rate: "Tuning/debugging bursts can hit three restarts per minute."
    burst_behavior: "Restart controller first writes a boundary marker, then clears focus/timers so downstream selectors stay predictable."
  risks:
  - "cursor or focus is left stale when the policy expects a clean ledger reset (VALIDATION P2)"
  notes: "The restart dock is the only place the policy touches session_id so we monitor it with the health harness."

## HEALTH INDICATORS SELECTED

```
health_indicators:

* name: store_ledger_append_only_integrity
  flow_id: store_stepper_atomic_commit
  priority: high
  rationale: "Append-only ledger integrity keeps exports verbatim and matches VALIDATION V1 and P1 constraints."

* name: store_atomic_commit_integrity
  flow_id: store_stepper_atomic_commit
  priority: high
  rationale: "Atomic commits guard ledger, focus, and explanation updates simultaneously so VALIDATION V2 and V3 hold under rapid clicks."

* name: store_single_focus_integrity
  flow_id: store_realtime_ingestion_append_and_retention
  priority: high
  rationale: "Exactly one focus stops duplicate-glow confusion and ensures V2 is always satisfied across telemetry and steppers."

* name: store_wait_timer_clamp_integrity
  flow_id: store_wait_timer_progress
  priority: med
  rationale: "Clamping the wait timer to 4.0 seconds at one decimal precision keeps the UI truthful, satisfying VALIDATION V4."

* name: store_export_equals_ledger
  flow_id: store_stepper_atomic_commit
  priority: high
  rationale: "Export outcomes must equal the ledger so copy/paste and debugging rely on P1-level guarantees."

* name: store_restart_policy_consistency
  flow_id: store_restart_session_clear_or_boundary
  priority: med
  rationale: "Restart actions must respect the configured policy and rotate session IDs so P2 remains provably true."
```

## OBJECTIVES COVERAGE

| Objective | Indicators | Why These Signals Matter |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| Ledger truth and export parity | store_ledger_append_only_integrity, store_atomic_commit_integrity, store_export_equals_ledger | These indicators confirm that every release writes a new event, updates focus/explanation atomically, and that exports mirror the ledger so audits and user-facing summaries stay accurate. |
| Focus and timer coherence | store_single_focus_integrity, store_wait_timer_clamp_integrity | These signals keep the visible focus, glow, and timer bars in sync with the underlying state even during telemetry ingestion or fast clicking. |
| Restart policy fidelity | store_restart_policy_consistency | This indicator proves that manual restarts honor the configured boundary policy, reset the cursor, and rotate session identifiers so stale state never leaks. |

## STATUS (RESULT INDICATOR)

```
status:
  stream_destination: ngram-marker:connectome/state_store/health
  result:
    representation: enum
    value: UNKNOWN
    updated_at: 2025-12-20T00:00:00Z
    source: health_check_ledger_is_append_only
```

This status entry is emitted to the Doctor health stream and is refreshed whenever the ledger integrity checker completes, so downstream tooling knows whether the metric is stable.

---

## DOCK TYPES (COMPLETE LIST)

- `event` — `dock_store_commit_action_invoked`, `dock_store_realtime_focus_updates`, `dock_store_session_restart` emit the timeline hooks that health listeners inspect before and after commits and restarts.
- `metric` — `dock_store_ledgers_synced` and `dock_store_retention_evictions` provide counters for exported ledger alignment and retention trimming.

These are the only dock types required for the state_store health harness, so we do not introduce custom categories beyond the standard ones above.

```

### ALGORITHM / CHECK MECHANISM

```yaml
mechanism:
  summary: "Compare the ledger before and after commit and ensure the exported blob equals the in-memory ledger."
  steps:
    - "Record the ledger length and hash exposed by the commit docking event before running the action."
    - "Allow the commit action to append the new FlowEvent and capture the metric the export serializer emits."
    - "Validate that the ledger length increased by exactly one, the previous entries still match their hashes, and the exported copy equals the ledger."
  data_required: "Ledger snapshots from docking telemetry and the JSONL/text serializer payload at export time."
  failure_mode: "Any deviation sets the indicator to 0 and triggers the `ledger_mutation` error."
```

### INDICATOR

```yaml
indicator:
  error:
    - name: ledger_mutation

  failure_mode: "Any discrepancy switches the indicator to 0 and surfaces the `export_mismatch` error."
```

### INDICATOR

```yaml
indicator:
  error:
    - name: export_mismatch
      linked_validation: [P1]
      meaning: "Exported data does not match the ledger entries."
      default_action: page/alert/stop
  warning:
    - name: export_latency
      linked_validation: [P1]
      meaning: "Export took longer than expected but still matched."
      default_action: warn/log
  info:
    - name: export_match
      linked_validation: [P1]
      meaning: "Export and ledger stay in lockstep."
      default_action: log
```

### THROTTLING STRATEGY

```yaml
throttling:
  trigger: dock_store_ledgers_synced
  max_frequency: 20/min
  burst_limit: 50
  backoff: "After a failure, restrict the export-only runs to 1/min until cleared."
```

### FORWARDINGS & DISPLAYS

```yaml
forwarding:
  targets:
    - location: ngram-marker:connectome/state_store/health
      transport: event
      notes: "Export health shares the same stream for completeness."
display:
  locations:
    - surface: Copy/export dialog
      location: Connectome log panel
      signal: green/red
      notes: "Red highlight prompts users to retry the export."
```

### MANUAL RUN

```yaml
manual_run:
  command: pnpm connectome:health state_store --checker health_check_export_equals_ledger
  notes: "Run copy/export and compare the output to the live ledger to guarantee parity."
```

## INDICATOR: store_restart_policy_consistency

### VALUE TO CLIENTS & VALIDATION MAPPING

```yaml
value_and_validation:
  indicator: store_restart_policy_consistency
  client_value: "Restart actions must reset or boundary the session as configured so operators can rely on the chosen policy."
  validation:
    - validation_id: P2
      criteria: "After restart the cursor is zero, focus cleared, timers reset, session_id changes, and ledger behavior matches the policy."
```

### HEALTH REPRESENTATION

```yaml
representation:
  allowed:
    - enum
  selected:
    - enum
  semantics:
    enum: "OK=policy satisfied, WARN=partial reset, ERROR=policy ignored."
  aggregation:
    method: "ERROR overrides WARN to ensure only successful restarts are reported as OK."
    display: "Health timeline annotates restart events with the enum state."
```

### DOCKS SELECTED

```yaml
docks:
  input:
    id: dock_store_session_restart
    method: restart_session_clear_or_boundary
    location: docs/connectome/state_store/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_State_Store_Code_Structure_And_Zustand_Actions.md:133-144
  output:
    id: dock_store_session_restart
    method: restart_session_clear_or_boundary
    location: docs/connectome/state_store/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_State_Store_Code_Structure_And_Zustand_Actions.md:133-144
```

### ALGORITHM / CHECK MECHANISM

```yaml
mechanism:
  summary: "Verify the restart controller respects the selected policy (clear vs boundary) by checking cursor, focus, timers, and session_id after the docking event fires."
  steps:
    - "Listen for the restart docking event and capture the policy choice at the time of the trigger."
    - "After the docking event, confirm cursor==0, focus cleared, timers reset, and session_id rotated."
    - "If the ledger behavior does not match the policy, escalate to WARN or ERROR depending on severity."
  data_required: "Restart docking telemetry plus the resulting ledger and session metadata."
  failure_mode: "Policy mismatches drive the indicator into WARN/ERROR so operators can re-run the restart."
```

### INDICATOR

```yaml
indicator:
  error:
    - name: restart_policy_violation
      linked_validation: [P2]
      meaning: "Restart ignored the configuration and left the ledger or focus inconsistent."
      default_action: stop
  warning:
    - name: restart_partial
      linked_validation: [P2]
      meaning: "Restart cleared focus but left the ledger boundary incorrect."
      default_action: warn/log
  info:
    - name: restart_ok
      linked_validation: [P2]
      meaning: "Restart obeyed the policy and reset session metadata."
      default_action: log
```

### THROTTLING STRATEGY

```yaml
throttling:
  trigger: dock_store_session_restart
  max_frequency: 10/min
  burst_limit: 30
  backoff: "Limiter tracks manual restarts and prevents more than 30 events per minute."
```

### FORWARDINGS & DISPLAYS

```yaml
forwarding:
  targets:
    - location: ngram-marker:connectome/state_store/health
      transport: event
      notes: "Restart signals join the main health stream for completeness."
display:
  locations:
    - surface: Restart modal
      location: Connectome UI
      signal: OK/WARN/ERROR
      notes: "Displays policy compliance so operators immediately see the result."
```

### MANUAL RUN

```yaml
manual_run:
  command: pnpm connectome:health state_store --checker health_check_restart_policy_consistency
  notes: "Trigger the restart button under both boundary and clear policies to see the enum state."
```

## HOW TO RUN

```
# Run all state_store health checks
pnpm connectome:health state_store

# Run a specific indicator checker only
pnpm connectome:health state_store --checker health_check_atomic_commit_updates_all_fields
```

---

## KNOWN GAPS

- [ ] Dock locations are unknown until the runtime implementation wires each telemetry emitter, so the `location` fields above may require later updates when the scripts exist (file:line = ?).
- [ ] Restart policy wiring is still in flux because policy A/B behavior has not been finalized, so the checks keep toggling between WARN and ERROR when the instrumentation is incomplete.

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

- [ ] Add a `commit_id` field that increments per atomic commit to make ledger comparison checks deterministic.
- IDEA: Emit health status to a persistent log file so the Doctor can replay indicator deltas after crashes.
- QUESTION: Should exports include a `session_id` header to help downstream replay tooling recover after restarts?
