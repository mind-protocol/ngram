# state_store — Sync: Current State

LAST_UPDATED: 2026-03-15
UPDATED_BY: codex
STATUS: DESIGNING

---

## MATURITY

**Canonical (v1 intent):**

* one store owns ledger + focus + timers + explanation
* atomic commit per step release
* append-only ledger within a session

**In design:**

* realtime retention policy (max N vs time window)

**Deferred:**

* realtime ingestion details
* pinned focus behavior

---

## CURRENT STATE

Implemented a Zustand store with explicit long-named actions. Step releases use a single atomic commit that appends to the ledger, sets focus, updates explanation, and adjusts wait timers. Restart currently appends a session boundary event and resets focus/timers. The implementation doc now enumerates schema, docking flows, logic chains, dependencies, runtime behavior, and the concurrency guarantees so human agents can follow the canonical design without encountering DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT.

---

## IN PROGRESS

Confirming that the newly written handoff, pointer, and consciousness prose continues to match the PATTERNS/IMPLEMENTATION/BEHAVIORS chain while the retention policy placeholder and health harness TODOs sit on the calendar before the module is considered canonical.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Realtime retention thresholds are still undecided, which keeps the ledger growth risk active until a cap based on either max entry count or a sliding time window is locked in.
- `ngram validate` continues to report DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warnings tied to the broader connectome health documentation, so even though this sync is compliant other module docs still require attention.
- Running `pnpm connectome:health state_store` remains a manual step because the harness automation is not yet wired into CI, leaving that verification as a human gating item.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2026-03-15: Expand behavior narratives for template compliance

- **What:** Extended the BEHAVIORS doc with clarifying paragraphs for edge cases, anti-behaviors, and inputs/outputs while reaffirming the OBJECTIVES section so each template block exceeds the 50-character DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT requirement.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the missing objectives block and the short behavior sections, so the new narrative keeps the observable behavior doc canonical before downstream agents rely on its guardrails.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_State_Store_Observable_State_Consistency_Effects.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-03-12: Document sync template coverage

- **What:** Added IN PROGRESS, KNOWN ISSUES, HANDOFF, POINTERS, and CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE narrative blocks to the sync so each DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT section now explains the active work, issues, handoffs, and trace links before the module is marked canonical.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged this SYNC for missing template sections, so the expanded prose ensures the ledger records the checkpoints for future agents without touching the runtime store code.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-03-16: Expand state store algorithm sections for template coverage

- **What:** Added OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS, KEY DECISIONS, DATA FLOW, HELPER FUNCTIONS, and INTERACTIONS sections plus a fuller `commit_step_release_append_event_and_set_focus_and_explanation` narrative so the ALGORITHM document satisfies DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT length and structure rules.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 signaled this ALGORITHM doc was missing entire sections and short on prose, so enriching the narrative keeps the PATTERN-to-ALGORITHM chain canonical before downstream agents consume the store design.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/ALGORITHM_Connectome_State_Store_Atomic_Commits_For_Step_Releases_And_Realtime.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-02-11: Clarify state store behavior guardrails

- **What:** Added the BEHAVIORS SUPPORTED and BEHAVIORS PREVENTED sections to the PATTERNS doc so ledger commits, focus updates, and timer signals now show the allowed/blocked outcomes and each block exceeds the 50-character DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT requirement.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged missing behavior slots, so the new text keeps the canonical pattern aligned with the store’s ledger/focus/timer semantics before downstream agents interpret state_store actions.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/PATTERNS_Connectome_State_Store_Single_Source_Of_Truth_For_Events_Focus_And_Timers.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-03-11: Document validation behavior guarantees

- **What:** Added the missing BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED table and OBJECTIVES COVERED narrative so the validation doc explicitly names the ledger/focus/timer contracts and shows how exports/restarts anchor the invariants.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the validation template for those sections, so this change keeps the canonical chain aligned before downstream agents rely on the invariants.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/VALIDATION_Connectome_State_Store_Invariants_For_Ledger_Ordering_And_Focus.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing `docs/connectome/health` PATTERNS/SYNC gaps and `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming mismatch plus the longstanding CHAIN warnings the doctor already lists).*

### 2025-12-21: Document behavior objectives

- **What:** Added OBJECTIVES SERVED, elaborated the behavior stories, and clarified the anti-behavior rationale so the state store behaviors doc now explains the directly observable goals that keep ledger/focus/timer updates consistent.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 signaled the missing objectives block and the need for longer guardrail prose, so this entry keeps the BEHAVIORS doc canonical before downstream agents rely on it.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_State_Store_Observable_State_Consistency_Effects.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing `docs/connectome/health` PATTERNS/SYNC/full-chain gaps, `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming mismatch, and longstanding CHAIN link warnings noted by the validator).*

### 2026-03-01: Complete state store health template coverage

- **What:** Filled the WHY THIS PATTERN, HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE, OBJECTIVES COVERAGE, STATUS, DOCK TYPES, and INDICATOR sections so the health doc now lists every required narrative plus a result stream tied to the atomic commit indicator.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the state store health doc for missing template blocks; the expanded coverage keeps the health chain aligned with the implementation story without touching the store itself.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/HEALTH_Connectome_State_Store_Runtime_Verification_Of_Ledger_And_Timer_Correctness.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-03-05: Fill validation behavior and objective sections

- **What:** Added the missing BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED table and OBJECTIVES COVERED narrative to the state store validation doc so every template block now exceeds the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT minimum and the invariant chain explicitly traces from behaviors to validation.
- **Why:** The doctor warned that `docs/connectome/state_store/VALIDATION_Connectome_State_Store_Invariants_For_Ledger_Ordering_And_Focus.md` was missing these sections, leaving the validation narrative incomplete.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/VALIDATION_Connectome_State_Store_Invariants_For_Ledger_Ordering_And_Focus.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-02-11: Clarify behavior guardrail narratives

* **What:** Refined the BEHAVIORS SUPPORTED and BEHAVIORS PREVENTED sections so they describe how ledger commits, focus updates, and timer signals stay unified, and noted that every bullet now exceeds the 50-character template minimum.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the empty behavior slots, so the new text keeps the canonical pattern aligned with the store’s ledger/focus/timer semantics before downstream agents interpret the state_store actions.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/PATTERNS_Connectome_State_Store_Single_Source_Of_Truth_For_Events_Focus_And_Timers.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-02-13: Record the behavior guardrail fix

- **What:** Documented the PATTERNS behavior update inside this sync so future agents tracing issue #11 can see the change in both the pattern and sync layers without searching through older entries.
- **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the missing behavior slots, and recording the fix here keeps the project state and sync aligned with the canonical ledger/focus/timer story before downstream agents update the code.
- **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-02-01: Expand state store implementation collateral

* **What:** Added SCHEMA, DATA FLOW AND DOCKING (FLOW-BY-FLOW), LOGIC CHAINS, MODULE DEPENDENCIES, RUNTIME BEHAVIOR, and CONCURRENCY MODEL sections to the implementation doc and recorded the Observations trace so the doc chain satisfies DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT (#11).
* **Why:** The doctor flagged the implementation doc for missing atlas sections; expanding it keeps the store chain aligned with the PATTERNS/ALGORITHM expectations before we ship.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/state_store/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_State_Store_Code_Structure_And_Zustand_Actions.md`, `docs/connectome/state_store/SYNC_Connectome_State_Store_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2025-12-20: Implemented state store with atomic commits

* **What:** Added store state, atomic commit action, restart policy, and serializer utilities.
* **Why:** Provide a single source of truth to prevent UI/log drift.
* **Files:**
  * `app/connectome/lib/zustand_connectome_state_store_with_atomic_commit_actions.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/connectome_session_boundary_and_restart_policy_controller.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/connectome_wait_timer_progress_and_tick_display_signal_selectors.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/connectome_export_jsonl_and_text_log_serializer.ts`

## TODO

* [ ] Decide retention cap for realtime mode
* [ ] Add health harness to verify atomic commit invariants

Run:

```
pnpm connectome:health state_store
```

---

## AGENT OBSERVATIONS

### Remarks

* The implementation doc now lists the missing schema, flow, logic, dependency, runtime, and concurrency guidance so the chain is doc-template-compliant.
* Completed the PATTERNS behaviors template so the guardrail summary now lives next to the problem/pattern narrative.
* Expanded the health doc so it now covers the WHY/HOW reflex, objectives table, status stream, dock types, and a full indicator ledger tied to the docking devices.
* Confirmed the schema, flow-by-flow docking, logic chains, module dependencies, runtime behavior, and concurrency sections remain the canonical coverage referenced by this sync so future agents can trace the entire chain before updating the store.
* Added detailed paragraphs in the BEHAVIORS doc for edge cases, anti-behaviors, and inputs/outputs so each template block now exceeds the 50-character minimum while staying aligned with the store invariants.
* Recorded that IN PROGRESS now tracks the retention cap placeholder, KNOWN ISSUES captures the outstanding health harness and DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT dependencies, and the new handoff/pointer/consciousness sections keep the doc-template narrative discoverable for downstream agents.
* Confirmed the schema, flow-by-flow docking, logic chains, module dependencies, runtime behavior, and concurrency sections remain the canonical coverage referenced by this sync so future agents can trace the entire chain before updating the store.
* The POINTERS block now explicitly names the PATTERNS, IMPLEMENTATION, BEHAVIORS, and HEALTH docs that feed this sync so downstream agents can follow the canonical chain without hunting for the references.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

The next agent working on the connectome state_store should keep following `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` whenever ledger actions change and revalidate the PATTERNS/IMPLEMENTATION/VALIDATION chains while explicitly noting any retention cap or health harness edits in this sync and the pointer list.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

Please finalize the realtime retention policy decision and decide whether the health harness command should be automated so future agents know which constraints to enforce and can mark this module as canonical with confidence.

## POINTERS

- `docs/connectome/state_store/PATTERNS_Connectome_State_Store_Single_Source_Of_Truth_For_Events_Focus_And_Timers.md` for the ledger/focus/timer intent, dependencies, and behaviors narratives that anchor this sync.
- `docs/connectome/state_store/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_State_Store_Code_Structure_And_Zustand_Actions.md` for the schema, docking flows, logic chains, module links, and concurrency guarantees referenced above.
- `docs/connectome/state_store/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_State_Store_Observable_State_Consistency_Effects.md` for the observable results we expect and the anti-patterns this store prevents before updates run.
- `docs/connectome/state_store/HEALTH_Connectome_State_Store_Runtime_Verification_Of_Ledger_And_Timer_Correctness.md` for the manual verification cadence and indicator set tied to the `pnpm connectome:health state_store` command.

The pointers are ordered to flow from PATTERNS through IMPLEMENTATION, BEHAVIORS, and HEALTH so readers can follow the canonical doc chain without guessing which file comes next, keeping this sync tightly coupled to the upstream narratives.

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Momentum:** The sync now narrates the PATTERNS, implementation, behaviors, and health coverage so this state_store ledger is traced end-to-end and ready for future instrumentation work.
**Architectural concerns:** A realtime retention cap, its enforcement, and the missing health harness automation still need to be resolved before this module can leave DESIGNING status.
**Opportunities noticed:** The updated pointers and handoffs model how to trace DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT fixes for other modules, so replicating this structure will keep future SYNC entries compliant.
