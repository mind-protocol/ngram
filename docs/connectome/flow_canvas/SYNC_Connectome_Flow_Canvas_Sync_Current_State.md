# flow_canvas — Sync: Current State

LAST_UPDATED: 2026-04-16
UPDATED_BY: codex
STATUS: DESIGNING
```

---

## MATURITY

**Canonical (v1 intent):**

* pannable/zoomable system map
* zones FE/BE/GRAPH/AGENTS
* deterministic layout
* stable edge rendering (no disappearance)

**In design:**

* label declutter thresholds
* minimap and drag behavior (deferred)

---

## CURRENT STATE

Implemented a React Flow-based FlowCanvas with force-directed node layout seeded by zones, stable edge rendering, and pannable/zoomable camera. Zones render as background nodes, and edges are keyed and stable. Fit-to-view is available via a small overlay button.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2026-04-11: Extend health template indicators (#11)

* **What:** Added indicator-level VALUE / REPRESENTATION / DOCK narratives, documented the binary STATUS stream, and lengthened HOW TO RUN plus the dock list so `HEALTH_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Runtime_Verification_Of_Render_Stability_And_Perf_Budgets.md` now exceeds all DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT requirements about indicator detail and execution guidance.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the canvas health doc for missing indicator stories and a too-short how-to-run block, so this ensures every watcher knows what to look for, where the results land, and how to rerun the harness.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/HEALTH_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Runtime_Verification_Of_Render_Stability_And_Perf_Budgets.md`, `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/SYNC_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing docs/connectome/health chain gaps plus docs/engine/membrane naming mismatch and longstanding CHAIN-link warnings still remain; no new regressions introduced)*.

### 2026-04-16: Fill algorithm template sections for flow canvas (#11)

* **What:** Added `OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS`, the top-level `render_flow_canvas_frame` summary, and the missing KEY DECISIONS / DATA FLOW / HELPER FUNCTIONS / INTERACTIONS narratives so the algorithm doc now satisfies DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11’s coverage and length requirements.
* **Why:** Ensures the algorithm narrative explicitly links objectives, decisions, data movement, helpers, and interaction guarantees before downstream agents rely on the implementation.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/ALGORITHM_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Layout_Zones_And_Edge_Label_Decluttering.md`, `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/SYNC_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: docs/connectome/health still lacks PATTERNS_/BEHAVIORS_/ALGORITHM_/VALIDATION_/IMPLEMENTATION_/SYNC coverage, `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` needs the plural PATTERNS prefix, and existing CHAIN/link warnings in docs/physics/* remain; no new failures introduced)*.

### 2026-04-10: Fill algorithm template sections for flow canvas (#11)

* **What:** Added `OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS`, a top-level `render_flow_canvas_frame` algorithm summary, and the missing KEY DECISIONS / DATA FLOW / HELPER FUNCTIONS / INTERACTIONS sections plus richer prose so the algorithm doc now meets the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT template length and coverage requirements.
* **Why:** Ensures the flow canvas algorithm narrative now fully documents the primary functions, decisions, data path, and interaction constraints that downstream engineers rely on.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/ALGORITHM_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Layout_Zones_And_Edge_Label_Decluttering.md`

### 2026-04-15: Expand implementation architecture coverage (#11)

* **What:** Documented the SCHEMA, FLOW-BY-FLOW data paths & docking points, LOGIC CHAINS, MODULE DEPENDENCIES, STATE MANAGEMENT, RUNTIME BEHAVIOR, and CONCURRENCY MODEL sections inside `IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Code_Structure_With_React_Flow_And_Zones` so each required template block now exists and exceeds the 50-character guidance.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the implementation doc for missing architectural context, leaving downstream engineers without reliable references for how the canvas consumes store data and orchestrates rendering.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Code_Structure_With_React_Flow_And_Zones.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: known gating issues persist—`docs/connectome/health` lacks PATTERNS/BEHAVIORS/ALGORITHM/VALIDATION/IMPLEMENTATION/SYNC, `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` still needs the plural name, and the longstanding CHAIN warnings for docs/physics/* remain).* 

### 2025-12-20: Switched node layout to force-directed for scale

* **What:** Added force-directed layout (d3-force) seeded by zone positions and linked by edges.
* **Why:** Support thousands of nodes without manual layout while preserving readability.
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/deterministic_zone_and_node_layout_computation_helpers.ts`, `app/connectome/components/pannable_zoomable_zoned_flow_canvas_renderer.tsx`.

### 2025-12-20: Implemented FlowCanvas with zones + deterministic layout

* **What:** Added React Flow renderer, zone nodes, deterministic node positions, and stable edge list.
* **Why:** Provide a readable, stable canvas as a debugging instrument in v1.
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/pannable_zoomable_zoned_flow_canvas_renderer.tsx`, `app/connectome/components/deterministic_zone_and_node_layout_computation_helpers.ts`.

### 2025-12-21: Filtered search edges without endpoints

* **What:** Filtered search edges to only render links with both endpoints present.
* **Why:** Avoid React Flow edge warnings and invalid edge entries when graph data is incomplete.
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/pannable_zoomable_zoned_flow_canvas_renderer.tsx`.

### 2025-12-21: Added LOD throttling for large graphs

* **What:** Reduced node/edge rendering detail based on zoom and graph size (hide labels, steps, motion).
* **Why:** Prevent 1fps when rendering large graphs.
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/pannable_zoomable_zoned_flow_canvas_renderer.tsx`, `app/connectome/components/edge_kit/semantic_edge_components_with_directional_shine_and_pulses.tsx`, `app/connectome/components/node_kit/typed_connectome_node_components_with_energy_and_step_highlighting.tsx`, `app/connectome/components/node_kit/connectome_node_frame_with_title_path_and_tooltip_shell.tsx`, `app/connectome/connectome.css`.

### 2025-12-21: Switched canvas renderer to WebGL

* **What:** Replaced React Flow rendering with a custom WebGL canvas + label overlay.
* **Why:** Maintain interactive performance on large graphs (WebGL points/lines).
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/pannable_zoomable_zoned_flow_canvas_renderer.tsx`, `app/connectome/connectome.css`.

### 2026-04-09: Complete flow canvas health template sections (#11)

* **What:** Added WHY THIS PATTERN, HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE, OBJECTIVES COVERAGE, STATUS, DOCK TYPES, indicator blocks, and expanded HOW TO RUN inside `HEALTH_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Runtime_Verification_Of_Render_Stability_And_Perf_Budgets.md` so every template block now exceeds the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT expectations and points readers at the standard HEALTH docks.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 specifically targeted the missing sections in this health doc; the new content keeps the runtime verification narrative aligned with VALIDATION and the downstream dashboards.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/HEALTH_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Runtime_Verification_Of_Render_Stability_And_Perf_Budgets.md`, `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/SYNC_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Sync_Current_State.md`  
* **Validation:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-04-08: Fill validation template drift sections for flow_canvas (#11)

* **What:** Added the missing BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED, OBJECTIVES COVERED, PROPERTIES, and SYNC STATUS sections to `VALIDATION_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Invariants_For_Readability_And_Stability.md` and expanded each narrative so the template now exceeds fifty characters per block.
* **Why:** Completes DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 for the validation doc and gives downstream agents a document that explicitly links behaviors, objectives, invariants, and syncing evidence.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/VALIDATION_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Invariants_For_Readability_And_Stability.md`

### 2026-04-10: Complete flow canvas algorithm template sections (#11)

* **What:** Added the OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS narrative, the primary `render_flow_canvas_frame` procedure, KEY DECISIONS, DATA FLOW, HELPER FUNCTIONS, and INTERACTIONS writeups so the algorithm doc now fulfills the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT requirements that prompted issue #11.
* **Why:** Ensures the canonical algorithm writeup explicitly connects objectives, behaviors, decisions, and interaction expectations to the implementation so downstream agents no longer encounter the incomplete template warning.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/ALGORITHM_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Layout_Zones_And_Edge_Label_Decluttering.md`, `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/SYNC_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Sync_Current_State.md`

### 2026-04-07: Add flow canvas behavior objectives and I/O (#11)

* **What:** Documented OBJECTIVES SERVED plus INPUTS/OUTPUTS details in `BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Readable_Stable_Interaction_Effects.md` so the template now describes the goals and data contracts for the canvas.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 highlighted the missing sections, and the new narrative keeps the canonical behavior doc aligned with the rest of the chain.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Readable_Stable_Interaction_Effects.md`
* **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2025-12-21: Document flow canvas pattern behaviors (#11)

* **What:** Replaced the empty placeholders with detailed `BEHAVIORS SUPPORTED` and `BEHAVIORS PREVENTED` narratives that spell out the pan/zoom camera guarantees, zone context resilience, focus persistence, LOD decluttering, and camera-control protections without falling below the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT length target.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 reported the PATTERNS doc lacked observable behavior guidance, so richer wording keeps the upstream design contract aligned with the rest of the flow canvas chain.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/PATTERNS_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Pannable_Zoomable_Zoned_System_Map_Rendering_Patterns.md`, `docs/connectome/flow_canvas/SYNC_Connectome_Flow_Canvas_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: docs/connectome/health lacks PATTERNS/SYNC/full-chain docs, docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md needs the plural naming, and legacy broken CHAIN links remain; none result from this change).*

## TODO

* [ ] Implement label declutter hooks in edge rendering (optional v1)
* [ ] Add a minimap only if navigation becomes painful

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- Documented the OBJECTIVES SERVED and INPUTS / OUTPUTS sections so DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 can now point to a canonical behavior narrative plus the data contract it relies on.
- Recorded the new algorithm sections so downstream agents can trace the primary `render_flow_canvas_frame` function, its decisions, and the helper math back to the SYNC log alongside the behavior/validation fixes.
- Keep tracking label declutter thresholds and zoom-based detail toggles so the readability guarantees mentioned in PATTERNS and VALIDATION stay true as graph size increases.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Capture label declutter threshold values in health/validation checks so future doctors can automatically flag when readability budgets are violated.

### Propositions
- Continue the TODO idea of showing only the active edge label when zoom is below a threshold as a future readability experiment once instrumentation collects bandwidth metrics.

Run:

```
pnpm connectome:health flow_canvas
```

## HANDOFF

**For agents:**

* Keep deterministic layout; do not introduce force layout in v1.
* Ensure edges keep stable ids and do not disappear on step transitions.

**For human:**

* Fit-to-view is implemented; node dragging remains disabled for determinism.
