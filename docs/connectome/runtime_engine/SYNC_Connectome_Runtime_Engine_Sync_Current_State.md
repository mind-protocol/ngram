# runtime_engine — Sync: Current State

LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-21
UPDATED_BY: codex
STATUS: DESIGNING
```

---

## MATURITY

**Canonical (v1 intent):**

* stepper: Next releases exactly one event
* speed modifies duration only, never authorization
* min duration clamp 200ms

**In design:**

* restart policy (boundary vs clear) now set to boundary event
* realtime buffering (deferred)

**Deferred:**

* realtime adapter wiring
* buffering policy and retention

---

## CURRENT STATE

Stepper runtime engine is implemented with a fixed step script. Next dispatches exactly one event through FlowEvent normalization and an atomic store commit. Speed affects animation duration but does not release additional events.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-21: Expand runtime engine algorithm coverage (#11)

* **What:** Filled the missing `OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS` narratives and added the high-level `runtime_engine_step_release_and_realtime_scheduler` algorithm summary so every template block now exceeds fifty characters while tying the release gate to realtime scheduling before downstream edits occur.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged those sections as missing; the new prose now maps the objectives and observable behaviors directly to the release_next_step and dispatch_runtime_command flows so the algorithm chain mirrors the implementation.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/ALGORITHM_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Step_Release_And_Realtime_Scheduling.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` (fails: known `docs/connectome/health` module chain gaps, the `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming convention issue, and longstanding CHAIN-link warnings remain; no new regressions introduced).

### 2026-05-01: Fill runtime engine validation template (#11)

* **What:** Added the BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED table plus the OBJECTIVES COVERED narrative to the runtime engine validation doc so every template block now exceeds fifty characters and ties the invariants back to user-facing guarantees.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged those missing sections, and the new prose makes it explicit which behaviors the invariants defend and why the validation is necessary before downstream agents rely on the runtime engine gating story.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/VALIDATION_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Invariants_For_Stepper_And_Realtime.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: known `docs/connectome/health` module chain gaps, the `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming convention issue, and existing CHAIN-link warnings remain; no new regressions introduced).*

### 2026-05-03: Document runtime engine algorithm objectives (Closes #11)

* **What:** Added the missing `OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS` section plus a primary `runtime_engine_step_release_and_realtime_scheduler()` overview so the algorithm doc now states why the stepper guard exists and how runtime commands flow before future agents edit the code.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged those template blocks as absent; the new narrative links objectives, behaviors, and scheduler sequencing back to the release implementation and meets the 50-character minimum.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/ALGORITHM_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Step_Release_And_Realtime_Scheduling.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: the known `docs/connectome/health` chain gaps, `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming mismatch, and persistent CHAIN-link warnings remain; no new issues introduced).*

### 2025-12-20: Implemented stepper runtime engine

* **What:** Added runtime command dispatch, step release logic, and initialization that sets script total.
* **Why:** Enforce stepper gating semantics and connect UI controls to a single release path.
* **Files:**
  * `app/connectome/lib/next_step_gate_and_realtime_playback_runtime_engine.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/minimum_duration_clamp_and_speed_based_default_policy.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/step_script_cursor_and_replay_determinism_helpers.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/connectome_step_script_sample_sequence.ts`

---

### 2025-12-21: Expand runtime engine implementation template (#11)

* **What:** Rewrote the `LOGIC CHAINS` and `MODULE DEPENDENCIES` sections in `IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Code_Structure_And_Control_Surface.md` with explicit concrete chains and dependency narratives so each block now exceeds the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT 50-character guidance.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the implementation doc for missing logic chains and dependency context, so the new prose makes the deterministic gating invariants and inter-module collaborations traceable before future agents touch the runtime wiring.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Code_Structure_And_Control_Surface.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: known `docs/connectome/health` chain gaps, `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming mismatch, and longstanding CHAIN-link warnings remain; no new regressions introduced).* 

---

### 2026-04-22: Expand runtime engine behavior template prose (#11)

* **What:** Added the missing `Side Effects` section plus elaborated the `OBJECTIVES SERVED` table, `EDGE CASES`, and `ANTI-BEHAVIORS` narratives so every behavior template block now explains why the manual stepper and realtime traversal guards matter while keeping each passage longer than fifty characters.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the objectives section and other short passages; the new explanations make the behavior contract traceable across inputs, outputs, edge cases, and anti-behavior guards.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_User_Controlled_Traversal_Effects.md`, `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails because `docs/connectome/health` still lacks PATTERNS+BEHAVIORS+ALGORITHM+VALIDATION+HEALTH/SYNC coverage and `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` needs the plural naming plus long-standing CHAIN link warnings remain; no new regressions were introduced).*

---

### 2026-04-17: Complete runtime engine health template narratives (Closes #11)

* **What:** Added a full OBJECTIVES COVERAGE table plus individual indicator stories for the pacing, speed, duration, and autoplay checks so the health doc now describes every required metric, dock, and threat with ≥50-character prose.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged missing objectives and indicator sections; the new narratives clarify what each signal defends and the guardrails downstream agents must audit.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/HEALTH_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Runtime_Verification_Of_Pacing_And_Order.md`, `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`, `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
* **Validation:** Pending the next `ngram validate` run; the change is purely documentation.

### 2026-04-18: Refine runtime_engine health coverage (#11)

* **What:** Reworked the OBJECTIVES COVERAGE table and added detailed indicator sections for speed, duration, and autoplay so every health signal now documents validation targets, docking points, and forwardings.
* **Why:** The doctor still flagged DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT for missing indicator details and objective coverage; adding the narratives keeps the runtime_engine health doc canonical for downstream agents.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/HEALTH_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Runtime_Verification_Of_Pacing_And_Order.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-04-18: Add runtime engine behavior objectives (Closes #11)

* **What:** Filled the missing `OBJECTIVES SERVED` table in the runtime engine behaviors doc so each behavior now maps to explicit goals with ≥50-character prose that explains why the stepper and realtime domains exist.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the absence of this section; documenting the objectives keeps downstream agents aligned with how traversal control protects deterministic playback and autplay boundaries.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_User_Controlled_Traversal_Effects.md`, `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` (still reports pre-existing `docs/connectome/health` chain gaps and membrane naming issues)

### 2026-04-26: Complete runtime_engine PATTERNS behavior sections (#11)

* **What:** Added the required `BEHAVIORS SUPPORTED` and `BEHAVIORS PREVENTED` narratives (B1/B2/B3 and A1/A2) to the runtime_engine patterns doc, spelling out the gating guarantees, presentation-rate guardrails, and UI/BMS anti-behaviors so each template block satisfies the 50-character minimum and links back to the behavior expectations.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged those sections as missing; filling them keeps the design intent traceable before agents edit runtime_engine code.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/PATTERNS_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Stepper_And_Realtime_Traversal_Control_Patterns.md`, `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate`

---

### 2026-04-20: Document runtime implementation logic chains (#11)

* **What:** Added LOGIC CHAINS and MODULE DEPENDENCIES sections to the implementation doc so every required structure block lists the runtime flows and external modules with at least fifty-character descriptions.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the implementation template for missing logic chains and dependency guidance; filling those sections keeps the canonical doc chain complete before future agents touch runtime wiring.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Code_Structure_And_Control_Surface.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
  * `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate`

## IN PROGRESS

- Instrumenting the realtime telemetry_adapter wiring so we can verify that step releases remain gated by the documented idle/active rhythms before enabling continuous play.
- Calibrating the restart boundary semantics so restarting the runtime engine respects ledger invariants while keeping the stepper/realtime distinction intact.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Realtime buffering instrumentation remains unfinished, so the telemetry stream cannot yet confirm guardrails during extended autoplay loops.
- The `docs/connectome/health` module still lacks the PATTERNS/BEHAVIORS/ALGORITHM/VALIDATION/IMPLEMENTATION/HEALTH/SYNC coverage that keeps `ngram validate` from passing on this module.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

- Continue routing observations through `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing` once realtime buffering fixtures are in place, with attention to the telemetry_adapter wiring noted above.
- Watch the connectome health docs and membrane naming issues referenced in the latest doctor run; do not expect validation clean without those fixes.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

- Confirm whether telemetry buffer instrumentation and the connectome health module documentation should be prioritized before the next release so downstream agents know when the validation suite can cleanly pass.
- Advise on any release gating requirements for realtime mode once the telemetry_adapter begins reporting playback health to the dashboard.

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

- Momentum is steady around finishing the telemetry_adapter and health docs, but the runtime engine sync was missing the communication scaffolding until now.
- Noticing the `view` balance, I explicitly logged the IN PROGRESS, KNOWN ISSUES, and handoff sections so the next agent can pick up where guardrail-specific documentation left off.

## POINTERS

- `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/PATTERNS_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Stepper_And_Realtime_Traversal_Control_Patterns.md`: Canonical design contract for why the stepper/realtime split exists and what behaviors each mode deliberately enables or prevents.
- `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_User_Controlled_Traversal_Effects.md`: Observable outcomes that every agent should link back to the gating guarantees enumerated here.
- `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Code_Structure_And_Control_Surface.md`: Structured logic chains and modules that realize the runtime command gating described in this SYNC.

## TODO

* [ ] Define realtime mode behavior once telemetry_adapter exists
* [ ] Decide whether restart should clear ledger vs boundary (currently boundary event)

Run:

```
pnpm connectome:health runtime_engine
```
