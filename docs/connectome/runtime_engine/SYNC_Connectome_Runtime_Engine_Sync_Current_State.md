# runtime_engine — Sync: Current State

LAST_UPDATED: 2026-04-18
UPDATED_BY: codex
STATUS: DESIGNING
```

---

## MATURITY

**Canonical (v1 intent):**

* stepper: Next releases exactly one event
* speed modifies duration only, never authorization
* min duration clamp 200ms

**In design:**

* restart policy (boundary vs clear) now set to boundary event
* realtime buffering (deferred)

**Deferred:**

* realtime adapter wiring
* buffering policy and retention

---

## CURRENT STATE

Stepper runtime engine is implemented with a fixed step script. Next dispatches exactly one event through FlowEvent normalization and an atomic store commit. Speed affects animation duration but does not release additional events.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2026-05-01: Fill runtime engine validation template (#11)

* **What:** Added the BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED table plus the OBJECTIVES COVERED narrative to the runtime engine validation doc so every template block now exceeds fifty characters and ties the invariants back to user-facing guarantees.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged those missing sections, and the new prose makes it explicit which behaviors the invariants defend and why the validation is necessary before downstream agents rely on the runtime engine gating story.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/VALIDATION_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Invariants_For_Stepper_And_Realtime.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: known `docs/connectome/health` module chain gaps, the `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming convention issue, and existing CHAIN-link warnings remain; no new regressions introduced).*

### 2025-12-20: Implemented stepper runtime engine

* **What:** Added runtime command dispatch, step release logic, and initialization that sets script total.
* **Why:** Enforce stepper gating semantics and connect UI controls to a single release path.
* **Files:**
  * `app/connectome/lib/next_step_gate_and_realtime_playback_runtime_engine.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/minimum_duration_clamp_and_speed_based_default_policy.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/step_script_cursor_and_replay_determinism_helpers.ts`
  * `app/connectome/lib/connectome_step_script_sample_sequence.ts`

### 2026-04-22: Expand runtime engine behavior template prose (#11)

* **What:** Added the missing `Side Effects` section plus elaborated the `OBJECTIVES SERVED` table, `EDGE CASES`, and `ANTI-BEHAVIORS` narratives so every behavior template block now explains why the manual stepper and realtime traversal guards matter while keeping each passage longer than fifty characters.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the objectives section and other short passages; the new explanations make the behavior contract traceable across inputs, outputs, edge cases, and anti-behavior guards.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_User_Controlled_Traversal_Effects.md`, `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails because `docs/connectome/health` still lacks PATTERNS+BEHAVIORS+ALGORITHM+VALIDATION+HEALTH/SYNC coverage and `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` needs the plural naming plus long-standing CHAIN link warnings remain; no new regressions were introduced).*

### 2026-04-17: Complete runtime engine health template narratives (Closes #11)

* **What:** Added a full OBJECTIVES COVERAGE table plus individual indicator stories for the pacing, speed, duration, and autoplay checks so the health doc now describes every required metric, dock, and threat with ≥50-character prose.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged missing objectives and indicator sections; the new narratives clarify what each signal defends and the guardrails downstream agents must audit.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/HEALTH_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Runtime_Verification_Of_Pacing_And_Order.md`, `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`, `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
* **Validation:** Pending the next `ngram validate` run; the change is purely documentation.

### 2026-04-18: Refine runtime_engine health coverage (#11)

* **What:** Reworked the OBJECTIVES COVERAGE table and added detailed indicator sections for speed, duration, and autoplay so every health signal now documents validation targets, docking points, and forwardings.
* **Why:** The doctor still flagged DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT for missing indicator details and objective coverage; adding the narratives keeps the runtime_engine health doc canonical for downstream agents.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/HEALTH_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Runtime_Verification_Of_Pacing_And_Order.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2026-04-18: Add runtime engine behavior objectives (Closes #11)

* **What:** Filled the missing `OBJECTIVES SERVED` table in the runtime engine behaviors doc so each behavior now maps to explicit goals with ≥50-character prose that explains why the stepper and realtime domains exist.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the absence of this section; documenting the objectives keeps downstream agents aligned with how traversal control protects deterministic playback and autplay boundaries.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_User_Controlled_Traversal_Effects.md`, `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` (still reports pre-existing `docs/connectome/health` chain gaps and membrane naming issues)

---

### 2026-04-20: Document runtime implementation logic chains (#11)

* **What:** Added LOGIC CHAINS and MODULE DEPENDENCIES sections to the implementation doc so every required structure block lists the runtime flows and external modules with at least fifty-character descriptions.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged the implementation template for missing logic chains and dependency guidance; filling those sections keeps the canonical doc chain complete before future agents touch runtime wiring.
* **Files:**
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Code_Structure_And_Control_Surface.md`
  * `docs/connectome/runtime_engine/SYNC_Connectome_Runtime_Engine_Sync_Current_State.md`
  * `.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate`

## TODO

* [ ] Define realtime mode behavior once telemetry_adapter exists
* [ ] Decide whether restart should clear ledger vs boundary (currently boundary event)

Run:

```
pnpm connectome:health runtime_engine
```
