# runtime_engine — Health: Verification Mechanics and Coverage

STATUS: DRAFT
CREATED: 2025-12-20
```

---

## PURPOSE OF THIS FILE

This HEALTH file verifies that runtime_engine preserves the guarantees that make /connectome a trustworthy debugger:

* stepper: one click → one event
* speed: presentation only (no authorization leak)
* minimum animation duration enforced
* no autoplay leaks in stepper mode

This file does not verify:

* edge rendering correctness (edge_kit)
* ledger storage correctness (state_store)
* backend correctness (Tempo/Canon invariants)

---

## WHY THIS PATTERN

Stepper dashboards fail silently: everything “looks animated” but the semantics are wrong.

HEALTH exists to make incorrect semantics visible:

* a double-release becomes a red indicator immediately
* an autoplay leak becomes a red indicator immediately

---

## HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

* Define the flows runtime_engine owns (stepper release; mode switch)
* Define checkers that can sample store state transitions
* Emit a simple enum status: OK/WARN/ERROR

## FLOWS ANALYSIS (TRIGGERS + FREQUENCY)

```
flows_analysis:

* flow_id: runtime_engine_stepper_next_step_release
  purpose: Guarantee “one Next → one event” and no autoplay.
  triggers:

  * type: manual
    source: UI button "Next step"
    notes: direct user command
    frequency:
    expected_rate: "human-driven: <= 5/min typical; burst <= 5/s"
    peak_rate: "human-driven; bounded"
    burst_behavior: "must remain correct under rapid clicking"
    risks:
  * "double-release bug"
  * "cursor desync"
  * "duration clamp missing"
    notes: "Realtime not required for v1"

* flow_id: runtime_engine_speed_change
  purpose: Ensure speed does not release steps in stepper mode.
  triggers:

  * type: manual
    source: UI speed selector
    frequency:
    expected_rate: "rare"
    peak_rate: "user spam"
    burst_behavior: "must not alter ledger/cursor"
    risks:
  * "autoplay leak due to speed timer"
    notes: "Speed is presentation only in stepper"
    ```

## HEALTH INDICATORS SELECTED

```
health_indicators:

* name: runtime_stepper_single_step_integrity
  flow_id: runtime_engine_stepper_next_step_release
  priority: high
  rationale: "If broken, /connectome cannot be trusted."

* name: runtime_speed_authorization_separation
  flow_id: runtime_engine_speed_change
  priority: high
  rationale: "Prevents the most common regression: speed triggers autoplay."

* name: runtime_min_duration_enforced
  flow_id: runtime_engine_stepper_next_step_release
  priority: med
  rationale: "Trust + readability requirement."

* name: runtime_autoplay_leak_detector
  flow_id: runtime_engine_stepper_next_step_release
  priority: high
  rationale: "Any release without Next in stepper is catastrophic."

## OBJECTIVES COVERAGE

| Objective | Indicators | Why These Signals Matter |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| Keep each manual step release deterministic so single-step debugging and logging remain trustworthy. | runtime_stepper_single_step_integrity, runtime_min_duration_enforced | These indicators verify the ledger/cursor deltas and animation duration clamp stay aligned with VALIDATION V1 and V3, preventing confusing double releases or blinking timelines. |
| Ensure speed selections are purely presentation controls so playback experiments never alter the ledger or cursor without user consent. | runtime_speed_authorization_separation | This signal proves that changing speed leaves the authorization boundary intact and only adjusts animation defaults, protecting VALIDATION V2 from regressions. |
| Prevent autoplay leaks so the stepper experience cannot drift into hidden automation that silently modifies the ledger. | runtime_autoplay_leak_detector | This indicator catches any event append that occurs without an explicit Next command, keeping the STEP/NO-STEP semantics intact for analysts and telemetry consumers. |

### MANUAL RUN

---

## HOW TO RUN

```
pnpm connectome:health runtime_engine
pnpm connectome:health runtime_engine --checker health_check_stepper_one_click_one_event
```

---

## KNOWN GAPS

* [ ] Dock locations are unknown until implementation exists (file:line = ?)
* [ ] Realtime-related indicators are deferred for v1

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* IDEA: Add a “rapid-click fuzz” mode to stress test V1 quickly.
* QUESTION: Should health checks run in CI, or only as an on-demand dev tool?
