## INVARIANTS

### V1: One Next click releases exactly one event (stepper mode)

```
IF mode==stepper AND command==next_step AND not end_of_script:
ledger_length increases by exactly 1
cursor increases by exactly 1
```

### V2: Speed does not change authorization (stepper mode)

```
IF mode==stepper:
changing speed must not change ledger_length or cursor
only affects computed animation duration defaults
```

### V3: Minimum duration clamp

```
FOR every released event:
animation_duration_ms >= 200ms
```

---

## PROPERTIES

### P1: Deterministic replay (stepper)

```
Given same step_script and same starting state:
sequence of released FlowEvents is identical (ignoring timestamps)
```

### P2: End-of-script is stable

```
After reaching end_of_script:
further next_step commands do not append events
```

---

## ERROR CONDITIONS

### E1: Double release per click

```
SYMPTOM: ledger_length increases by >1 for a single Next command
SEVERITY: ERROR
```

### E2: Autoplay leak in stepper mode

```
SYMPTOM: events released without a Next command when mode==stepper
SEVERITY: ERROR
```

## VERIFICATION PROCEDURE

### Manual Checklist

```
[ ] Click Next once → exactly one new log entry
[ ] Switch speed to 3x → click Next once → still exactly one entry
[ ] Run to end → click Next → no new entry; UI says end reached
[ ] Set a step duration to 10ms → animation still takes >=200ms
```

### Automated

```
pnpm connectome:health runtime_engine
```

---

# Run tests

```
pnpm connectome:health runtime_engine
```

# Run with coverage

```
pnpm connectome:health runtime_engine --coverage
```

RESULT:
V1: NOT RUN
V2: NOT RUN
V3: NOT RUN

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: Do we treat “Restart” as a new session boundary in determinism checks?
* IDEA: Add a “command ledger” (Next/Restart/Mode changes) for auditability (v2)
