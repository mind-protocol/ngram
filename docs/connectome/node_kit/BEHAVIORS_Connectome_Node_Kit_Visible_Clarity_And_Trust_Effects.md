## BEHAVIORS

### B1: Node identity is obvious at a glance

```
GIVEN:  the diagram is visible at zoom=1.0
THEN:   a user can instantly distinguish Player vs UI vs Module vs Graph vs Agent nodes
BECAUSE: backgrounds and title styling encode type and language
```

### B2: The title leads; file path is secondary

```
GIVEN:  a node shows a title and a file path
THEN:   the title is prominent and colored
AND:    the path is small, discreet, and not bold
```

### B3: Active step inside a node is clearly highlighted, one-at-a-time

```
GIVEN:  a FlowEvent specifies step_key for a node
WHEN:   the step becomes active
THEN:   exactly one list item is highlighted (bold + colored by call type)
AND:    previous items revert when Next is clicked
```

### B4: Energy feels like energy

```
GIVEN:  a node has an energy value
THEN:   the energy badge glow reflects the value (grey→blue→orange→yellow)
AND:    energy changes cause a brief glow accent (optional)
```

### B5: Wait progress bar is truthful and bounded

```
GIVEN:  player sent a message and no answer arrived
THEN:   PlayerNode shows a progress bar filling over max 4.0s with 0.1 precision seconds display
AND:    color shifts as it approaches max
```

### B6: Tick cron node communicates pacing without requiring reading

```
GIVEN:  speed is pause/1x/2x/3x
THEN:   TickCronNode shows a circular fill aligned to nominal tick interval
AND:    center shows speed label
AND:    color changes with speed
```

### B7: “Flipped” nodes are visually distinct

```
GIVEN:  a node is marked flipped/interrupt=true (source ?)
THEN:   it has a distinct glow ring so it “pops” from normal activation
```

---

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

### A1: Node rendering re-implements event normalization

```
MUST NOT: infer callType/trigger from raw payload in node rendering
INSTEAD: consume callType/trigger/step_key already normalized/stored
```

### A2: Energy values displayed without consistent mapping

```
MUST NOT: show arbitrary colors for energy without mapping rule
INSTEAD: use deterministic mapping function from ALGORITHM
```

---

## EDGE CASES

### E1: Unknowns

```
GIVEN:  a node lacks language/type info
THEN:   it renders with default neutral styling and shows “?” in tooltip
```

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: Do we display multiple energy metrics (energy, weight, salience) in v1? (recommend: energy only for now)
