## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)
1. Provide the main entry point and layout for the Connectome feature. — Ensures a consistent user experience and navigation.
2. Orchestrate interactions between Connectome sub-modules. — Facilitates data flow and event handling across the feature.
3. Manage global styling and shared UI elements for the Connectome feature. — Maintains visual consistency and reduces redundancy.

## NON-OBJECTIVES
- Implement core business logic for specific Connectome functionalities (e.g., graph algorithms, state management). — These are delegated to dedicated sub-modules.
- Handle API interactions directly. — These are delegated to dedicated API modules.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)
- When simplicity of top-level component composition conflicts with granular control over sub-module rendering, choose simplicity to enable faster development and clearer initial architecture.
- We accept potential initial over-rendering costs to preserve a unified top-level shell that integrates easily with Next.js routing.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)
- The Connectome feature page loads correctly with all integrated sub-modules.
- Global Connectome-specific styles are applied consistently.
- Navigation within the Connectome feature is fluid and predictable.
