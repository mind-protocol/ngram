## OBJECTIVES SERVED

- Guarantee that the “Now” sentence and ledger rows reuse the same state_store data so the active explanation, focus summary, and step cursor never contradict the ledger history.
- Lock every copy/export handler to the state_store serializer so exports preserve session boundaries, FlowEvent ids, and duration colors for replay without ambiguity or drift.
- Surface the trigger, call_type, and duration semantics inside this section so downstream agents know which badges and colors should appear when verifying the panel behavior.

## INPUTS / OUTPUTS

### INPUTS

- `state_store.ledger` events plus their trigger, call_type, timestamp, and duration metadata feed every ledger row, duration color, and badge emitted in the panel.
- `state_store.current_explanation`, `state_store.active_focus`, and `state_store.step_cursor` provide the explanation sentence, arrow focus summary, and step position so the “Now” section mirrors the ledger sequence.
- `state_store.health_badges` and `state_store.session_meta` anchor badge tooltips and export headers with the rubric that auditors expect when they replay or share the log.

### OUTPUTS

- Live ledger rows, duration text, badge styling, and “Step X of Y” messaging reflect the same information derived from the store, making the UI representation auditable for downstream tools or operators.
- Copy/export actions produce deterministic JSONL/text payloads that include session markers, FlowEvent ids, and duration colors so the exported ledger can be replayed or inspected without ambiguity.

## BEHAVIORS

### B1: One step has one explanation sentence, always in sync

```
GIVEN:  a step is released
THEN:   the “Now” sentence updates exactly once
AND:    it matches the most recent ledger event
AND:    the active focus shown in the panel matches the active edge glow
```

### B2: “Step X of Y” is always readable and unambiguous

```
GIVEN:  ledger has N entries and step script has total T (if known)
THEN:   the panel displays “Step (cursor) of (T)” (or “Step (cursor)” if T unknown)
AND:    never displays ambiguous shorthand like “#9/16”
```

### B3: Duration coloring communicates severity at a glance

```
GIVEN:  a duration exists
THEN:   duration text is color-coded:
ms: blue
<1s: green
<2s: yellow
<3s: orange
else: red
```

### B4: Trigger types are visibly distinct in the log

```
GIVEN:  trigger is direct/stream/async/hook/timer
THEN:   a trigger badge uses distinct colors (deterministic palette)
```

### B5: Export is copy/paste reliable

```
GIVEN:  user clicks “Copy log”
THEN:   clipboard contains a stable representation of the ledger
AND:    user can paste it back into tools to replay/debug
```

---

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

### A1: Log line lies about what happened

```
MUST NOT: display an explanation that doesn’t correspond to the last event
INSTEAD: explanation is derived from the last released FlowEvent
```

### A2: Export does not match ledger

```
MUST NOT: export a filtered/partial list without telling the user
INSTEAD: export indicates filters, or exports full ledger by default
```

---

## EDGE CASES

### E1: Unknown duration

```
GIVEN:  duration is unknown
THEN:   display “?” with muted styling
AND:    show notes in tooltip
```

### E2: Realtime bursts (deferred)

```
GIVEN:  realtime emits many events
THEN:   log remains usable with retention/pagination policy (owned by state_store)
```

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: Should duration thresholds be configurable? (v1: no, fixed)
* IDEA: Provide a “copy last 20” option in v1.1
