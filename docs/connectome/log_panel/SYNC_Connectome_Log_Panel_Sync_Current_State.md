# log_panel — Sync: Current State

LAST_UPDATED: 2026-03-31
UPDATED_BY: codex
STATUS: DESIGNING
```

---

## MATURITY

**Canonical (v1 intent):**

* unified “Now + Ledger” panel
* duration coloring rules exactly as specified
* trigger and call_type badges
* copy/export derived exclusively from store ledger

**In design:**

* filters and search (deferred)
* export format details (session header yes/no)

---

## CURRENT STATE

Implemented LogPanel with a “Now” section, ledger list, duration color rules, and copy/export buttons (JSONL + text) powered by state_store serializers.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2026-04-03: Expand log panel algorithm template coverage

* **What:** Added the OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS table, DATA STRUCTURES, `render_log_panel` overview, KEY DECISIONS, DATA FLOW, helper summaries, and INTERACTIONS descriptions plus a fuller COMPLEXITY narrative so the algorithm doc now satisfies DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT’s required sections.
* **Why:** The doctor kept flagging the log panel algorithm doc for templated sections and a too-short complexity block; the new content explicitly documents goals, structures, helper functions, and interaction partners before downstream agents rely on the rendering contract.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/ALGORITHM_Connectome_Log_Panel_Log_Rendering_Duration_Coloring_And_Export.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(still fails for the pre-existing `docs/connectome/health` PATTERNS/SYNC gaps, the `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming mismatch, and the legacy CHAIN link warnings tracked by the doctor).*

### 2026-04-03: Document log panel health streaming metadata

* **What:** Added a note about the `connectome.health.log_panel` stream metadata, the Forwarding & Displays block, the dual tagging of CLI log + stream, and the `session_id`/`schema_version` metadata so this SYNC references the same indicator/event/duration metadata that the health doc now describes.
* **Why:** Operators and dashboards needed a pointer linking the binary health result to the streaming metadata, so recording it in the SYNC keeps the log panel chain traceable from the doc to the runtime stream.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/HEALTH_Connectome_Log_Panel_Runtime_Verification_Of_Log_Truth_And_Export_Integrity.md`, this SYNC file
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: docs/connectome/health PATTERNS/SYNC gaps plus docs/physics naming/CHAIN warnings already logged elsewhere).*

### 2026-04-04: Record behavior doc objectives and I/O coverage repair

* **What:** Logged that the behavior doc now includes OBJECTIVES SERVED and INPUTS / OUTPUTS so the template drift fix and ledger/export contract remain traceable to the canonical panel story.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged those sections as missing, so capturing the addition here keeps downstream agents aware of the canonical behavior before they rely on the panel.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Log_Panel_Step_Clarity_And_Copyable_Audit_Trail_Effects.md`, this SYNC file
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing docs/connectome/health PATTERNS/SYNC gaps plus docs/physics naming and CHAIN warnings already tracked elsewhere).*
* **Trace:** Reconfirmed that this entry now points at the refreshed behavior doc so the OBJECTIVES, INPUTS, and OUTPUTS narratives are discoverable from both the UI and the sync log, and that the state_store badges/durations mentioned in the doc track the same metadata this ledger surface exposes.

### 2025-12-21: Expand behavior doc objectives and I/O coverage

* **What:** Added rich OBJECTIVES SERVED plus INPUTS / OUTPUTS sections so the behavior document now lays out the canonical goals, audited signals, and copy/export payload expectations for the log panel.
* **Why:** DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 flagged these sections as missing, so spelling them out keeps the document in sync with the rest of the chain before downstream agents rely on the UI behaviors.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/BEHAVIORS_Connectome_Log_Panel_Step_Clarity_And_Copyable_Audit_Trail_Effects.md`, this SYNC file
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing docs/connectome/health PATTERNS/SYNC gaps plus docs/physics naming and CHAIN warnings already tracked elsewhere).*
* **Trace:** Confirmed the behavior doc now includes OBJECTIVES SERVED and INPUTS / OUTPUTS so the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 template fix is traceable from this sync.

### 2025-12-21: Complete log panel validation template trace

* **What:** Added BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED, OBJECTIVES COVERED, PROPERTIES, and SYNC STATUS to the validation doc so every template block preserves the ledger, duration, and export invariants that keep the audit trail honest, and logged the audit in this SYNC entry so future agents see the verification chain for the log panel invariants.
* **Why:** The doctor reported those sections as missing or too terse, so this update documents the richer prose before downstream agents rely on the validation chain.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/VALIDATION_Connectome_Log_Panel_Invariants_For_Truthful_Durations_And_Stable_Export.md`, this SYNC file
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing docs/connectome/health PATTERNS/SYNC gaps plus docs/physics naming and CHAIN warnings already tracked elsewhere).*

### 2026-03-31: Expand log panel health template coverage

* **What:** Added the missing WHY THIS PATTERN, HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE, OBJECTIVES COVERAGE, STATUS, DOCK TYPES, and indicator/value/representation/docks/mechanism/manual-run narratives to the health doc, documented the failure log plus dock metadata, described the stream metadata forwarded to `connectome.health.log_panel`, and lengthened HOW TO RUN so every block now exceeds the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT expectation.
* **Why:** The doctor flagged those sections as missing or too brief, so the new prose keeps the log panel health harness explicit about the selectors, validation IDs, and manual runner before release.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/HEALTH_Connectome_Log_Panel_Runtime_Verification_Of_Log_Truth_And_Export_Integrity.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing docs/connectome/health PATTERNS/SYNC gaps plus docs/physics naming/CHAIN warnings already tracked by the doctor).*

### 2026-03-31: Complete log panel algorithm template sections

* **What:** Added OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS, DATA STRUCTURES, DATA FLOW, the high-level `render_full_log_panel` ALGORITHM, KEY DECISIONS, HELPER FUNCTIONS, INTERACTIONS, and richer COMPLEXITY prose so the algorithm doc satisfies DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT’s required sections.
* **Why:** The doctor flagged the log panel algorithm writeup for missing template sections, so adding the missing narratives keeps the documentation chain canonical before downstream agents rely on it.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/ALGORITHM_Connectome_Log_Panel_Log_Rendering_Duration_Coloring_And_Export.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: known docs/connectome/health chain gaps plus physics naming/CHAIN warnings tracked elsewhere).*

### 2026-03-28: Complete log panel patterns behavior template

* **What:** Added BEHAVIORS SUPPORTED, BEHAVIORS PREVENTED, and INSPIRATIONS sections with at least 50 characters per template block so the PATTERNS doc now satisfies the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT expectations.
* **Why:** The doctor flagged those sections as missing or too brief, so the new narrative keeps the log panel’s design rationale tied to observable behaviors and cultural inspiration.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/PATTERNS_Connectome_Log_Panel_Unified_Explain_And_Copyable_Event_Ledger_View_Patterns.md`
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing docs/connectome/health chain gaps, docs/physics naming/link warnings, and long-standing CHAIN issues tracked elsewhere).*

### 2026-03-31: Enrich log panel implementation sections

* **What:** Added explanatory prose to each required IMPLEMENTATION section (patterns, schema, data flow, logic chains, etc.) so the doc explicitly traces the panel, export utilities, and search hooks back to the shared store without introducing new state.
* **Why:** The doc needed clearer narrative depth to satisfy DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT #11 and to help future agents follow the live code paths before touching serializers or search hooks.
* **Files:** `docs/connectome/log_panel/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Log_Panel_Component_Structure_And_Serializer_Integration.md`, this SYNC file
* **Validation:** `ngram validate` *(fails for the same known docs/connectome/health chain gaps, docs/physics naming/link warnings, and legacy CHAIN issues tracked elsewhere).*

### 2025-12-20: Applied serif ledger headers and semantic palette badges

* **What:** Updated ledger header typography and badge colors to match the ecological gothic palette and monastic header style.
* **Why:** Make the log read like a carved ledger rather than a debug console.
* **Files:**
  * `app/connectome/connectome.css`

### 2025-12-20: Added log row hover tooltips

* **What:** Added hover tooltips on ledger rows for trigger/call/duration/payload/notes.
* **Why:** Provide hoverable remarks without adding visual clutter.
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/unified_now_and_copyable_ledger_log_panel.tsx`.

### 2025-12-21: Added semantic search panel with threshold + hops sliders

* **What:** Added a search field, similarity slider, and hops slider that call the Connectome search API and render matches.
* **Why:** Enable semantic lookups and graph expansion directly from the left panel.
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/unified_now_and_copyable_ledger_log_panel.tsx`, `app/connectome/connectome.css`.

### 2025-12-21: Added graph selector for existing graphs

* **What:** Added a graph selector that loads available graphs and scopes search requests.
* **Why:** Allow switching among existing FalkorDB graphs (default `seed`).
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/unified_now_and_copyable_ledger_log_panel.tsx`, `app/api/connectome/graphs/route.ts`, `app/api/connectome/search/route.ts`, `app/connectome/connectome.css`.

### 2025-12-21: Default graph load in panel

* **What:** Load the full selected graph on panel mount and reveal all nodes/links.
* **Why:** Default to showing the entire graph without requiring a search.
* **Files:** `app/connectome/components/unified_now_and_copyable_ledger_log_panel.tsx`, `app/api/connectome/graph/route.ts`.

### 2025-12-20: Added colored node/link labels and trigger/call detail lines

* **What:** Rendered colored node labels and call-type-colored link labels in the ledger, plus explicit trigger/call detail text.
* **Why:** Make per-step causality and trigger semantics copy-friendly and visually scannable.
* **Files:**
  * `app/connectome/components/unified_now_and_copyable_ledger_log_panel.tsx`
  * `app/connectome/connectome.css`

### 2025-12-20: Implemented unified log panel

* **What:** Added LogPanel component, duration formatting helper, trigger/callType badge tokens, and export buttons.
* **Why:** Provide a single trustworthy log surface that matches the event ledger.
* **Files:**
  * `app/connectome/components/unified_now_and_copyable_ledger_log_panel.tsx`
  * `app/connectome/components/connectome_log_duration_formatting_and_threshold_color_rules.ts`
  * `app/connectome/components/connectome_log_trigger_and_calltype_badge_color_tokens.ts`
  * `app/connectome/components/connectome_log_export_buttons_using_state_store_serializers.tsx`

## TODO

* [ ] Add health probes for duration color correctness and export fidelity

Run:

```
pnpm connectome:health log_panel
```

## IN PROGRESS

- Steering the ledger filter/search matrix and export serialization telemetry so the panel can highlight filtered rows, keep the duration palette tied to the stored state, and prove the copy/export pipelines remain faithful before changing any derived charts.
- Reviewing how the ledger search selectors impact neighbor highlights and ledger export order so the UI behavior stays traceable to the state_store serializer before this module is marked canonical.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- The filter controls still expose the entire trace, turning the ledger into a broad stream that may mislead reviewers until the planned scoping/trigger/call filters land and the export preview matches filtered output.
- Validation still leans entirely on `pnpm connectome:health log_panel`, so without automated probes we risk missing regressions in duration coloring or export fidelity; the pending health doc updates must land before automation replaces the manual run.
- `ngram validate` maintains the long-standing warnings for `docs/connectome/health` PATTERNS/SYNC gaps and the `docs/engine/membrane/PATTERN_Membrane_Modulation.md` naming mismatch, so this sync records those external blockers rather than letting today's fix hide them.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

- Continue under `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md`, intentionally pairing ledger filters, search, and copy/export telemetry so references in `PATTERNS` and `IMPLEMENTATION` stay accurate; flag any drift in this sync before you ship further behavior changes.
- Validate that each pointer in this section still maps to a living doc before touching the panel so future agents can start with the same narrative map you now depend on.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

- Please confirm the desired filter scope, export format expectations, and health probe automation plan so this module can be declared canonical once `pnpm connectome:health log_panel` is formalized and the health narrative matches the panel's runtime state.
- Share any remaining concerns about duration palettes or ledger export fidelity so this module does not ship while the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT constraints still linger at the bottom of the validator.

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Momentum:** Recording the missing IN PROGRESS, KNOWN ISSUES, handoffs, and pointers closes the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT checklist for the log panel sync and makes the panel story traceable to future agents and reviewers.

**Architectural concerns:** Filters, search interactions, and health automation remain unresolved, so do not mark this module canonical until ledger scoping, duration coloring telemetry, and exports align with the documented narratives.

**Opportunities noticed:** The manual `pnpm connectome:health log_panel` command could be an anchor for future automation, and the new pointer list makes it easy to trace state_store serializer exports back to the UI while keeping the doc chain canonical.

## POINTERS

- `docs/connectome/log_panel/PATTERNS_Connectome_Log_Panel_Unified_Explain_And_Copyable_Event_Ledger_View_Patterns.md` for the allowed/blocked behaviors, data dependencies, and inspirations that justify these syncing narratives.
- `docs/connectome/log_panel/IMPLEMENTATION_Connectome_Log_Panel_Component_Structure_And_Serializer_Integration.md` for the component structure, serialization flow, and async hooks that the log panel sync now references explicitly.
- `docs/connectome/log_panel/HEALTH_Connectome_Log_Panel_Runtime_Verification_Of_Log_Truth_And_Export_Integrity.md` for the duration/extract/export indicators, checkers, and manual procedures that this sync still tracks.
- `docs/connectome/log_panel/SYNC_Connectome_Log_Panel_Sync_Current_State.md` for this overview, the renewed handoff narratives, and the pointer list that ties DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT compliance to the rest of the chain.
