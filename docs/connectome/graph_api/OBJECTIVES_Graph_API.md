# OBJECTIVES — Connectome Graph API

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)
1. Provide graph data to the Connectome UI — Enables visualization and interaction with the graph.
2. Expose a stable API for graph operations — Allows other modules to reliably consume graph data.
3. Ensure efficient retrieval of graph data — Optimizes performance for large graphs.

## NON-OBJECTIVES
- Graph persistence logic — This module focuses on serving data, not its storage.
- Complex graph analysis — Advanced algorithms belong elsewhere, this is for basic data retrieval.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)
- When data freshness conflicts with performance, prioritize performance for initial loads, then provide mechanisms for updates.
- We accept potential data staleness for faster initial load times.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)
- Graph loads quickly in the Connectome UI.
- API endpoints respond within acceptable latency limits.

title: "Refine Connectome Graph API objectives"
priority: medium
context: |
  The current objectives are high-level. More specific objectives may emerge as the module matures.
task: |
  Review existing Connectome module documentation and codebase to refine or add more specific objectives for the graph API.
