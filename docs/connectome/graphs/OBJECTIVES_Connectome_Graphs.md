# OBJECTIVES: Connectome Graphs Module

## Context
This document outlines the objectives and high-level purpose of the Connectome Graphs module.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- **Provide API for Listing Graphs:** To expose an HTTP GET endpoint (`/api/connectome/graphs`) that allows clients to retrieve a list of available graphs from the FalkorDB database.
- **Abstract Graph Listing Logic:** To encapsulate the execution of the Python CLI command (`engine.physics.graph.connectome_read_cli --list-graphs`) for interacting with FalkorDB, abstracting away the underlying child process management.

### Secondary Objectives
- **Error Handling:** To gracefully handle errors during the execution of the Python script or parsing of its output, returning informative error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Environment Configuration:** To respect environment variables (`NGRAM_FALKORDB_HOST`, `NGRAM_FALKORDB_PORT`) for configuring the FalkorDB connection.
- **Python Version Fallback:** To attempt execution with `python3` if `python` command fails (e.g., due to `ENOENT` error).

## Non-Objectives
- Graph manipulation (creation, deletion, modification) is out of scope for this module.
- Detailed graph data retrieval is handled by other modules, not this one.

## CHAIN
- Relates to `app/api/connectome/graphs/route.ts`
- Implements part of the `connectome` feature area.
