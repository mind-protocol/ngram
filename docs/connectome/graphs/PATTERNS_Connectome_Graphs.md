# PATTERNS: Connectome Graphs Module

## Context
This document describes the design patterns and conventions followed within the Connectome Graphs module.

## Patterns

### 1. Next.js API Route
- **Pattern:** The module utilizes a Next.js API route (`route.ts`) to expose backend functionality via a simple HTTP endpoint.
- **Rationale:** Leverages Next.js's built-in API routing for easy integration with the frontend and standard HTTP request handling.

### 2. Child Process Execution for Backend Logic
- **Pattern:** Python CLI commands are executed as child processes (`spawnSync`) to interact with the FalkorDB graph database.
- **Rationale:** Allows leveraging existing Python backend logic and tools for graph operations without reimplementing complex database interactions in TypeScript/JavaScript. Provides isolation between the Next.js application and the Python engine.

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration
- **Pattern:** Database host and port are configured via environment variables (`NGRAM_FALKORDB_HOST`, `NGRAM_FALKORDB_PORT`).
- **Rationale:** Promotes configurability and allows easy adaptation to different deployment environments without code changes.

### 4. Robust Error Handling and Reporting
- **Pattern:** Explicit error checks are performed for child process execution failures (`result.error`, `result.status`) and JSON parsing issues. Errors are returned as JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 500).
- **Rationale:** Ensures that API consumers receive clear feedback on issues, aiding debugging and robust client-side error management.

## Anti-Patterns
- **Direct Database Access:** This module avoids direct database connection from Node.js, deferring to the Python engine.
