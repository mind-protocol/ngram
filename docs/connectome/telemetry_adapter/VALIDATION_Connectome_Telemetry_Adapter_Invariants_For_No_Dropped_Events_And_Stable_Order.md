## INVARIANTS

### V1: Every SSE frame produces an envelope

```
For each received SSE frame:
exactly one RawTelemetryEnvelope is emitted
(even if parsing fails)
```

### V2: Ordering is stable

```
arrival_index is strictly increasing within a session
Envelopes are emitted in arrival_index order
```

### V3: Parse failures are explicit

```
If JSON parse fails:
envelope.parse_error is set
envelope.parsed_json is null
envelope.notes includes "?"
```

### V4: Connection state is explicit

```
telemetry_adapter maintains a visible connection_state:
connecting|connected|error|disconnected
```

### V5: No unbounded buffering (if adapter buffers internally)

```
If telemetry_adapter buffers:
buffer length is capped by configured retention policy
overflow behavior is explicit (WARN) and counted
```

(If buffering is in runtime_engine/state_store, then telemetry_adapter must still expose rate and error metrics.)

## ERROR CONDITIONS

### E1: Silent drop detected

* severity: ERROR
* meaning: realtime mode cannot be trusted

### E2: Envelope ordering violation

* severity: ERROR
* meaning: log replay becomes incoherent

## HEALTH COVERAGE

| Validation | Health Indicator                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| V1         | telemetry_envelope_emission_integrity            |
| V2         | telemetry_arrival_order_integrity                |
| V3         | telemetry_parse_failure_visibility               |
| V4         | telemetry_connection_state_integrity             |
| V5         | telemetry_buffer_bound_integrity (if applicable) |

---

## VERIFICATION PROCEDURE

### Manual

```
[ ] Turn on realtime → see connecting→connected
[ ] Inject malformed SSE payload → see parse_error and “?” in log
[ ] Disconnect network → see error state and retry behavior
```

### Automated

```
pnpm connectome:health telemetry_adapter
```

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: Where does “session” boundary live for arrival_index? (store session_id vs adapter local) → `?`
