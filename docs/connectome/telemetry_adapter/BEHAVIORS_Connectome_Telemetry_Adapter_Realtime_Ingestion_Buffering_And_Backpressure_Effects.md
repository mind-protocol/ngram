## BEHAVIORS

### B1: Realtime mode visibly connects or fails

```
GIVEN:  user switches to realtime mode
THEN:   telemetry_adapter reports connection state (connected / connecting / error)
AND:    the UI can show a clear badge
```

### B2: Every SSE frame becomes a logged event (even if unknown)

```
GIVEN:  an SSE event arrives (recognized or not)
THEN:   telemetry_adapter produces a raw envelope
AND:    event_model produces a FlowEvent (notes="?" when unknown)
AND:    it appears in the ledger log
```

### B3: Local pause buffers rather than losing information (bounded)

```
GIVEN:  mode=realtime and local_pause=true
WHEN:   events arrive
THEN:   they are buffered
AND:    buffer size is visible in UI/health
AND:    buffer does not grow unbounded (retention policy applies)
```

### B4: Resume drains in a stable order

```
GIVEN:  local_pause flips false
THEN:   buffered events drain in stable ordering policy (arrival order)
AND:    the UI does not reorder unexpectedly
```

### B5: Backpressure signals are available

```
GIVEN:  ingestion rate becomes high
THEN:   telemetry_adapter exposes rate metrics and parse errors
AND:    health checks can alert on overload or drops
```

---

## ANTI-BEHAVIORS

### A1: Silent drops

```
MUST NOT: discard unknown or malformed events without logging
INSTEAD: preserve with notes="?" and raw_payload (if debug enabled)
```

### A2: UI parses SSE directly

```
MUST NOT: parse EventSource payloads in components
INSTEAD: telemetry_adapter centralizes parsing and emits envelopes
```

---

## EDGE CASES

### E1: Malformed JSON payload

```
GIVEN:  SSE data is not valid JSON
THEN:   telemetry_adapter creates an envelope with data_text preserved
AND:    marks parse_error and notes="?"
```

### E2: Disconnect/reconnect

```
GIVEN:  SSE connection drops
THEN:   telemetry_adapter retries with backoff
AND:    connection status updates accordingly
```

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* QUESTION: Should reconnect reset arrival_index or continue monotonic? (prefer continue per session)
* IDEA: allow “pause but still show connection status” (buffering continues)
