# telemetry_adapter — Health: Stream Integrity, Parse Errors, Rate, and Buffer Bounds

STATUS: DRAFT
CREATED: 2025-12-20
```

---

## PURPOSE OF THIS FILE

telemetry_adapter HEALTH ensures realtime ingestion stays trustworthy:

* no silent drops (every SSE frame becomes an envelope)
* parse failures are visible and counted
* connection state transitions are visible
* event rate and buffering are monitored (overload signals)

This does not validate backend semantics (Tempo/Canon); it validates ingestion integrity only.

## FLOWS ANALYSIS (TRIGGERS + FREQUENCY)

```
flows_analysis:

* flow_id: telemetry_sse_frame_ingestion
  purpose: Ensure no drops and visible parse errors.
  triggers:

  * type: stream
    source: EventSource (browser)
    frequency:
    expected_rate: "?/s (depends on backend)"
    peak_rate: "?/s"
    burst_behavior: "possible bursts during fast tempo"
    risks:
  * "silent drops"
  * "parse errors hidden"
  * "order drift"
    notes: "Rates unknown until backend stream observed."

* flow_id: telemetry_connection_lifecycle
  purpose: Ensure status is visible during connect/retry.
  triggers:

  * type: event
    source: EventSource open/error
    frequency:
    expected_rate: "rare"
    risks:
  * "stuck connecting"
  * "no retry"
    ```

## HEALTH INDICATORS SELECTED

```
health_indicators:

* name: telemetry_envelope_emission_integrity
  flow_id: telemetry_sse_frame_ingestion
  priority: high
  rationale: "Without this, realtime cannot be trusted."

* name: telemetry_parse_failure_visibility
  flow_id: telemetry_sse_frame_ingestion
  priority: high
  rationale: "Malformed payloads must not vanish."

* name: telemetry_arrival_order_integrity
  flow_id: telemetry_sse_frame_ingestion
  priority: high
  rationale: "Out-of-order makes tracing unusable."

* name: telemetry_connection_state_integrity
  flow_id: telemetry_connection_lifecycle
  priority: med
  rationale: "Operators must know whether telemetry is real."

## HOW TO RUN

```
pnpm connectome:health telemetry_adapter
```

---

## KNOWN GAPS

* [ ] needs a harness to simulate SSE frames in dev/test
* [ ] actual backend event list unknown, so mapping is partially `?`

---

## GAPS / IDEAS / QUESTIONS

* IDEA: Provide a built-in “mock telemetry generator” for health checks (no backend required).
* QUESTION: Should telemetry_adapter expose a “schema_version” from backend docks? (reserved)
