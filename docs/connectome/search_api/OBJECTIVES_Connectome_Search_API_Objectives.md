## PRIMARY OBJECTIVES (ranked)
1. Provide a robust and performant API endpoint for connectome graph searches. — Enables UI and other services to query the graph effectively.
2. Delegate complex graph search logic to the specialized `connectome_read_cli` Python tool. — Leverages existing, optimized graph processing capabilities.
3. Ensure reliable communication with the underlying Python CLI and graceful error handling. — Prevents API failures due to CLI issues and provides informative feedback.

## NON-OBJECTIVES
- Direct graph manipulation (e.g., adding/removing nodes/edges). — This functionality is handled by other connectome APIs (e.g., `connectome_graph_api`).
- Implementing graph search algorithms within the Node.js layer. — This is the responsibility of the `connectome_read_cli` Python tool.
- Complex query parsing or natural language understanding. — The API expects structured query parameters, and the CLI handles its own parsing.

## TRADEOFFS (canonical decisions)
- When **API simplicity** conflicts with **deep configuration of the underlying CLI**, choose **API simplicity**. The API focuses on essential search parameters.
- We accept **potential latency introduced by inter-process communication (Node.js to Python CLI)** to preserve **the robustness and existing capabilities of the Python-based graph engine**.

## SUCCESS SIGNALS (observable)
- API response times for search queries are consistently below X milliseconds (TBD).
- Error rates from the search API are below Y% (TBD).
- Search results accurately reflect the output of the `connectome_read_cli` tool.

<!-- @ngram:todo
title: "Define specific latency and error rate metrics"
priority: medium
context: |
  The success signals for performance and reliability are currently placeholders (X and Y).
  These need to be concretely defined to properly monitor the API's health.
task: |
  Consult with performance requirements or existing benchmarks to set specific millisecond and percentage values for API response times and error rates.
