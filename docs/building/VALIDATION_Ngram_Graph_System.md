## TESTS VS HEALTH

**Tests gate completion. Health monitors runtime.**

| Concern | Tests (CI) | Health (Runtime) |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| When | Build time | Production |
| Data | Fixtures | Real graph |
| Catches | Code bugs | Emergent drift |
| Blocks | Merge/deploy | Alerts/pages |

### Write Tests For

| Category | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Context assembly rules | Deterministic filtering |
| Link creation | Known triggers |
| Narrative type mapping | Finite enum |
| Ingest correctness | Parseable input |

### Use Health Only For

| Category | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Energy drift | Needs many ticks |
| Agent differentiation | Emergent over time |
| Context quality | Subjective, sampled |
| World liveness | Continuous monitoring |

## PRIORITY LEVELS

| Priority | Meaning | Requirement |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HIGH` | System breaks without this | MUST have verified_by |

## MARKERS

<!-- @ngram:todo Write test suite for context assembly invariants -->
<!-- @ngram:todo Write health checkers for energy/strength monitoring -->
<!-- @ngram:todo Define HOT_THRESHOLD, ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD constants -->
<!-- @ngram:todo Define MAX_CONTEXT_NARRATIVES constant -->

<!-- @ngram:escalation [Q3] Ongoing vs Stuck Goal — how to distinguish goals that should stay active from goals that are stuck?
  Options:
    A) Time-based: goal older than X days without progress = stuck
    B) Activity-based: goal with no linked Moments in Y ticks = stuck
    C) Energy-based: goal that received energy but didn't complete = stuck
    D) Explicit: human marks goal as stuck
  Opinion: (B) Activity-based. Time alone doesn't indicate stuck — some goals are long-term. But a goal receiving energy (agents working) with no new Moments is suspicious. Health check: if goal.energy > 0.5 for 100+ ticks with no new linked Moments, flag as potentially stuck. Human reviews.
  Phase: 6 -->

<!-- @ngram:escalation [Q4] Strength Unbounded — over years, doesn't everything max out?
  Options:
    A) Hard cap at 1.0 (or 10.0)
    B) Soft decay: strength decays slowly if not reinforced
    C) Relative strength: normalize across graph
    D) No cap, strength is unbounded
  Opinion: (B) Soft decay. Hard cap loses information — everything at max is useless. Unbounded causes overflow/precision issues. Soft decay: strength *= 0.999 per tick if no new reinforcement. Old connections fade unless actively used. This is biological — synapses weaken without use. Preserves ranking while preventing explosion.
  Phase: 2 -->

<!-- @ngram:escalation V-NGRAM-AGENT-TRIGGERS-ON-HOT — if 3 Moments are hot, which one? Highest energy? Random? -->
<!-- Covered by Q2 in ALGORITHM -->

<!-- @ngram:proposition Add invariant V-NGRAM-NO-ORPHAN-NARRATIVES — every Narrative should be in at least one Space -->
<!-- @ngram:proposition Add invariant V-NGRAM-HUMAN-GENERATES-MOST — human energy generation should be measurably higher than agents to ensure steering -->
<!-- @ngram:proposition Add health check for "agent diversity" — alert if all agents converge to same beliefs/spaces -->
