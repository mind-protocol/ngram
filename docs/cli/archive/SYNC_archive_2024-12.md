# CLI Archive: Pre-2025 Summary

Archived on: 2025-12-20
Scope: Legacy CLI notes consolidated for size reduction.

---

## MATURITY

- STATUS: ARCHIVED (legacy snapshot, not part of active work)

## CURRENT STATE

- Captures the CLI doc history preceding 2025; no active items remain.

## IN PROGRESS

- None; this archive is read-only.

## RECENT CHANGES (ARCHIVED)

- Historical CLI refactor notes and extraction history were rolled into the 2025 snapshot for context.
- No 2024 items remain active; the file keeps a placeholder for legacy imports.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- None; the file only records historical notes and should not drive current decisions.

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

- Refer to `docs/cli/core/SYNC_CLI_Development_State.md` for anything actionable; this file provides legacy context only.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

- No action required unless auditing legacy CLI doc decisions.

## TODO

- [ ] Archive future CLI snapshots in the same folder once the active structure stabilizes.

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

- Retain this archive only while comparing pre-2025 doc choices; drop once the 2024 history is referenced elsewhere.
