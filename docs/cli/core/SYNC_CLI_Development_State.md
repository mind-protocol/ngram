## MATURITY

- STATUS: CANONICAL  (CLI doc chain stabilized after prompt health refactor; content remains in active use)

---

## CURRENT STATE

The CLI is stable and in active use. Core commands: `init`, `validate`, `doctor`, `repair`, plus supporting `sync/context/prompt/map/agents`.
Documented the new `docs/cli/prompt/` module: added PATTERNS → HEALTH files that describe how `ngram prompt` bootstraps agents and referenced `ngram/prompt.py` in DOCS comments.
Updated `ngram/repair_core.py` issue lookup helpers to handle empty and mixed-case issue types without being flagged as incomplete implementations.
Verified `ngram/doctor_files.py` already implements the previously flagged empty functions; no code changes required for the INCOMPLETE_IMPL report.
Added a new `ngram refactor` command that renames/moves documentation paths, rewrites doc/module references, and reruns overview/doctor so structural changes stay synchronized.
`ngram init` now copies `.ngram/skills` into `.claude/skills` and `$CODEX_HOME/skills` so agent skills stay installed during protocol refreshes.

## IN PROGRESS

### Prompt module doc chain

- **Started:** 2025-12-21
- **By:** codex
- **Status:** in progress
- **Context:** Created template-based docs under `docs/cli/prompt/` and recorded sync state; still need to expand each doc with canonical references, invariants, and health wiring.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Parallel agent output can intermix during `repair --parallel` (low severity)

---

## CONFLICTS

### RESOLVED: modules.yaml mapping mismatch
- Resolution: `modules.yaml` now includes module mappings for CLI, engine, and tools.
- Updated: 2025-12-20

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

- Use `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md` when adding commands or `VIEW_Debug_Investigate_And_Fix_Issues.md` for bug fixes; CLI core health docs are stable, so focus on template drift elsewhere if needed.

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

- CLI is stable and documented; no immediate input requested unless additional health orchestrations surface new drift warnings.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-20: Pending external implementation references

- **What:** Replaced stub file paths with pending import notes in implementation docs.
- **Why:** Remove broken impl links until upstream code is imported.

### 2025-12-20: Todo marker support

- **What:** Added `@ngram&#58;todo` marker support to `solve-markers` and doctor special marker detection.
- **Why:** Allows agents and managers to capture actionable tasks during reviews and triage them explicitly.
- **Files:** `ngram/solve_escalations.py`, `ngram/doctor_checks_content.py`, `docs/cli/core/ALGORITHM_CLI_Command_Execution_Logic/ALGORITHM_Markers_And_Support.md`, `docs/cli/core/BEHAVIORS_CLI_Command_Effects.md`, `docs/cli/core/VALIDATION_CLI_Instruction_Invariants.md`

### 2025-12-20: Archive consolidation note

- **What:** Clarified the CLI archive scope after consolidating duplicate TUI archive content.
- **Why:** Prevents confusion between CLI archives and other module archives.
- **Files:** `docs/cli/archive/SYNC_CLI_State_Archive_2025-12.md`

### 2025-12-20: Split CLI algorithm and implementation docs

- **What:** Split CLI algorithm and implementation docs into overview + part files and condensed archived notes.
- **Why:** Reduce module doc size and keep entry points concise.
- **Files:** `docs/cli/core/ALGORITHM_CLI_Command_Execution_Logic/ALGORITHM_Overview.md`, `docs/cli/core/IMPLEMENTATION_CLI_Code_Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_Overview.md`, `docs/cli/archive/SYNC_CLI_Development_State_archive_2025-12.md`

### 2025-12-21: Add CLI refactor command

- **What:** Introduced `ngram/refactor.py`, wired `ngram refactor rename`, and documented the flow alongside existing CLI materials.
- **Why:** Enables deterministic structural refactors so the documentation tree and modules manifest stay coherent after renames/moves.
- **Files:** `ngram/refactor.py`, `docs/cli/core/ALGORITHM_CLI_Command_Execution_Logic/ALGORITHM_Refactor_Command.md`, `docs/cli/core/BEHAVIORS_CLI_Command_Effects.md`, `docs/cli/core/IMPLEMENTATION_CLI_Code_Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_Overview.md`, `docs/cli/core/SYNC_CLI_Development_State.md`
- **Extras:** The command now offers `move`, `promote`, `demote`, and `batch` actions plus `--overwrite` (default), `--skip-existing`, and `--no-overwrite` flags so collisions can be handled deterministically.

### 2025-12-21: Adjust doctor doc sizing threshold + stub detection

- **What:** Increased the large-doc-module threshold to 62.5K chars and refined stub-only detection to avoid flagging short helpers.
- **Why:** Reduce false positives while keeping large module warnings meaningful.
- **Files:** `ngram/doctor_checks_docs.py`, `ngram/doctor_checks_stub.py`, `docs/protocol/doctor/SYNC_Project_Health_Doctor.md`

### 2025-12-20: Copy skills during init

- **What:** `ngram init` now copies `.ngram/skills` into `.claude/skills` and `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.
- **Why:** Keeps agent skill installs in sync with protocol refreshes without manual copying.
- **Files:** `ngram/init_cmd.py`, `docs/cli/core/BEHAVIORS_CLI_Command_Effects.md`, `docs/cli/core/IMPLEMENTATION_CLI_Code_Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_Runtime_And_Dependencies.md`

## GAPS

### Completed
- Escaped literal escalation markers in `docs/cli/core/SYNC_CLI_Development_State.md`.
- Reviewed `docs/cli/core/ALGORITHM_CLI_Command_Execution_Logic/ALGORITHM_Overview.md` for escalation marker conflicts.

### Remaining
- Resolve the escalation marker once a human decision is provided.

### Blockers
- No human decision was supplied for the escalation conflict, so no doc change was made.

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- INCOMPLETE_IMPL report for `ngram/doctor_files.py` was already resolved; no code changes needed.
- The issue lookup helpers in `ngram/repair_core.py` are now robust against empty or mixed-case issue types, preventing false positives in the incomplete implementation check.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Consider updating the doctor incomplete-impl heuristic to ignore short, explicit dictionary lookup helpers to reduce noise.
### Propositions
- @ngram:TODO Add automation that flags the prompt module as lacking health runners when `HEALTH_Prompt_Runtime_Verification.md` stays in DESIGNING status for too long.

### Propositions
- None.

## TODO

- [ ] Expand the CLI prompt docs (PATTERNS→HEALTH) with canonical references, invariants, and health wiring so doctor drift warnings resolve completely.
- [ ] Update `modules.yaml` to include CLI helper modules such as `ngram/repair_core.py` and `ngram/repo_overview.py` to silence the current doc-link drift warnings.
- [ ] Extend `ngram refactor` with `move`, `promote`, and `demote` subcommands after the rename routine proves stable.
- IDEA: Introduce `@ngram:thing:docs/...` tagging helpers so refactor can update `@ngram:id` anchors instead of string rewrites.

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

- Observations: CLI docs now follow the PATTERNS→HEALTH chain, but template drift lives in other modules; keeping the doc-chain canonical requires constant verification with `ngram doctor`.
- Uncertainty: Need to confirm whether guiding the next agent to `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md` remains accurate when new CLI commands are added.
