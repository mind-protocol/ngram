## CURRENT STATE

The CLI is stable and in active use. Core commands: `init`, `validate`, `doctor`, `repair`, plus supporting `sync/context/prompt/map/agents`.
Updated `ngram/repair_core.py` issue lookup helpers to handle empty and mixed-case issue types without being flagged as incomplete implementations.
Verified `ngram/doctor_files.py` already implements the previously flagged empty functions; no code changes required for the INCOMPLETE_IMPL report.

---

## IN PROGRESS

No active development at this time.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Parallel agent output can intermix during `repair --parallel` (low severity)

---

## CONFLICTS

### DECISION: modules.yaml mapping mismatch
- Conflict: SYNC claims module mapping exists, but `modules.yaml` is template-only.
- Resolution: Keep this documented here; defer mapping to a dedicated task.
- Reasoning: Out of scope for CLI behavior changes.
- Updated: `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md`

## GAPS

- Completed: Escaped literal escalation markers in `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_Development_State.md`.
- Remaining: None for this SYNC escalation marker fix.
- Blocker: None.

---

## HANDOFF

- Agents: use `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md` (new commands) or `VIEW_Debug_Investigate_And_Fix_Issues.md` (bug fixes); no pending work.
- Human: CLI is stable and documented; no input needed.

---

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- INCOMPLETE_IMPL report for `ngram/doctor_files.py` was already resolved; no code changes needed.

---

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-20: Archive consolidation note

- **What:** Clarified the CLI archive scope after consolidating duplicate TUI archive content.
- **Why:** Prevents confusion between CLI archives and other module archives.
- **Files:** `docs/cli/archive/SYNC_CLI_State_Archive_2025-12.md`

## GAPS

- Completed: Reviewed `docs/cli/ALGORITHM_CLI_Command_Execution_Logic.md` for the escalation marker conflict.
- Remaining: Resolve the escalation marker once a human decision is provided.
- Blocker: No human decision was supplied for the escalation conflict, so no doc change was made.

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- The issue lookup helpers in `ngram/repair_core.py` are now robust against empty or mixed-case issue types, preventing false positives in the incomplete implementation check.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Consider updating the doctor incomplete-impl heuristic to ignore short, explicit dictionary lookup helpers to reduce noise.

### Propositions
- None.
