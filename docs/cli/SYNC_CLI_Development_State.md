## CURRENT STATE

The CLI is stable and in active use. Core commands: `init`, `validate`, `doctor`, `repair`, plus supporting `sync/context/prompt/map/agents`.

---

## IN PROGRESS

No active development at this time.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Parallel agent output can intermix during `repair --parallel` (low severity)

---

## CONFLICTS

### DECISION: modules.yaml mapping mismatch
- Conflict: SYNC claims module mapping exists, but `modules.yaml` is template-only.
- Resolution: Keep this documented here; defer mapping to a dedicated task.
- Reasoning: Out of scope for CLI behavior changes.
- Updated: `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md`

## GAPS

- Completed: Escaped literal escalation markers in `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_Development_State.md`.
- Remaining: None for this SYNC escalation marker fix.
- Blocker: None.

---

## HANDOFF

- Agents: use `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md` (new commands) or `VIEW_Debug_Investigate_And_Fix_Issues.md` (bug fixes); no pending work.
- Human: CLI is stable and documented; no input needed.

---

## GAPS

- Completed: Reviewed `docs/cli/ALGORITHM_CLI_Command_Execution_Logic.md` for the escalation marker conflict.
- Remaining: Resolve the escalation marker once a human decision is provided.
- Blocker: No human decision was supplied for the escalation conflict, so no doc change was made.
