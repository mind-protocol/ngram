## MATURITY

**What's canonical (v1):**
- `gemini_agent.py` provides a Gemini CLI wrapper for the TUI/CLI.
- Streamed JSON output matches the TUI expectations used by other agents.

**What's still being designed:**
- Shared abstractions for additional LLM providers.
- Expanded tool schema support and richer message formatting for Gemini.

**What's proposed (v2+):**
- A reusable adapter base class for multi-provider consistency.
- Configurable model selection via CLI flags.

---

## CURRENT STATE

`ngram/llms/gemini_agent.py` implements a standalone CLI process that authenticates with GEMINI_API_KEY (CLI arg, `.env`, or env var), sends a prompt to Gemini, streams JSON output for the TUI, and executes basic local tools (filesystem/search/web fetch). Google search requests use a configurable base URL via `NGRAM_GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL`. The CLI builds the subprocess invocation from `ngram/agent_cli.py` when the `gemini` provider is selected.

---

## IN PROGRESS

No active implementation work is underway; the last changes were
documentation-only updates, and adapter behavior is unchanged.

---

## RECENT CHANGES

- ### 2025-12-25: Filled Gemini algorithm template length requirements

- **What:** Added the missing `OBJECTIVES AND BEHAVIORS` section and renamed the algorithm narrative to call out `main()` so every template requirement exceeds 50 characters.
- **Why:** Close the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning pointing at `ALGORITHM_Gemini_Stream_Flow.md` by making objectives explicit and highlighting the primary entrypoint responsible for running the Gemini subprocess.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/ALGORITHM_Gemini_Stream_Flow.md`, `docs/llm_agents/SYNC_LLM_Agents_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` (fails: existing `docs/connectome/health` gaps plus naming/CHAIN warnings noted by the doctor)

### 2025-12-25: Expanded Gemini health coverage template

- **What:** Added the OBJECTIVES COVERAGE table plus richer `stream_validity` and `api_connectivity` indicator sections describing algorithm mechanics, throttling, forwardings, and manual run guidance.
- **Why:** Close the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning for `HEALTH_LLM_Agent_Coverage.md` while giving doctors precise streaming and connectivity signals.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/HEALTH_LLM_Agent_Coverage.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2025-12-25: Expanded Gemini implementation doc to runtime detail

- **What:** Added sections covering code structure, design patterns, schema, flow-by-flow docking, logic chains, dependencies, state handling, runtime behavior, concurrency, and bidirectional links so the implementation doc now satisfies the template expectations.
- **Why:** Resolve the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning pointing at `IMPLEMENTATION_LLM_Agent_Code_Architecture.md` by giving each required heading substantive narrative and clarifying how the adapter interacts with the CLI and TUI.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/IMPLEMENTATION_LLM_Agent_Code_Architecture.md`, `docs/llm_agents/SYNC_LLM_Agents_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing connectome health doc gaps, membrane naming, and CHAIN/link warnings already tracked by the doctor)*

### 2025-12-21: Added objectives and lengthened Gemini behaviors text

- **What:** Added an OBJECTIVES SERVED section and expanded the NOTES/INPUTS/OUTPUTS narratives so each template passage exceeds 50 characters while highlighting how streams, plain text, and diagnostics interact.
- **Why:** Close the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning for the Gemini behaviors doc that noted missing objectives and overly brief sections.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/BEHAVIORS_Gemini_Agent_Output.md`, `docs/llm_agents/SYNC_LLM_Agents_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` (fails: existing connectome health doc gaps, membrane naming, and CHAIN link warnings noted by doctor)

### 2025-12-20: Filled Gemini behaviors template sections

- **What:** Added INPUTS/OUTPUTS, EDGE CASES, ANTI-BEHAVIORS, and GAPS sections to the Gemini behaviors doc.
- **Why:** Resolve DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT for the behaviors template and clarify output expectations.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/BEHAVIORS_Gemini_Agent_Output.md`

### 2025-12-21: Added PATTERNS behavior sections

- **What:** Filled the provider subprocess PATTERNS doc with BEHAVIORS SUPPORTED and BEHAVIORS PREVENTED narratives so the template is complete.
- **Why:** Close the DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning for this PATTERNS file and spell out the observable effects of the subprocess boundary.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/PATTERNS_Provider_Specific_LLM_Subprocesses.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2025-12-21: Completed Gemini validation template

- **What:** Added the BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED table and OBJECTIVES COVERED narrative to describe the observable guarantees and goals for the Gemini adapter.
- **Why:** Resolve DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT for the validation template and give downstream agents explicit behavior assertions to rely on.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/VALIDATION_Gemini_Agent_Invariants.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2025-12-22: Documented Gemini behavior objectives

- **What:** Added the missing `OBJECTIVES SERVED` section and expanded the NOTES/INPUTS/OUTPUTS narrative so every Gemini behaviors template section exceeds the length threshold.
- **Why:** Resolve DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT for the behaviors doc and keep the objectives and I/O story explicit for future agents.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/BEHAVIORS_Gemini_Agent_Output.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate`

### 2025-12-23: Formalized Gemini validation behavior/objective tables

- **What:** Replaced the brief bullet lists with BEHAVIORS GUARANTEED and OBJECTIVES COVERED tables in the Gemini validation doc and expanded each rationale so every section exceeds the 50+ character threshold.
- **Why:** Resolve the remaining DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning, give downstream agents explicit guarantees/objective alignment, and keep the template length expectations satisfied.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/VALIDATION_Gemini_Agent_Invariants.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` *(fails: pre-existing connectome health doc gaps and chain/link warnings noted by the doctor)*

### 2025-12-24: Detailed LLM health coverage into objective + connectivity sections

- **What:** Added an OBJECTIVES COVERAGE summary and a dedicated API connectivity indicator so the HEALTH template now captures both streaming and auth verification flows.
- **Why:** Close the remaining DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning tied to the health doc and link the API connectivity signal to the `api_connectivity` indicator.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/HEALTH_LLM_Agent_Coverage.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` *(fails: pre-existing connectome health doc gaps and chain/link warnings noted by the doctor)*

### 2025-12-25: Populate LLM implementation architecture doc

- **What:** Expanded `IMPLEMENTATION_LLM_Agent_Code_Architecture.md` with code structure, module layout, design patterns, schema, flows, logic chains, dependencies, state transitions, runtime/concurrency, configuration, bidirectional links, and GAPS/IDEAS/Q entries so every template bucket now has 50+ characters of guidance.
- **Why:** The doc drift warning listed missing sections such as logical flows, state management, and concurrency; filling them keeps the implementation doc aligned with downstream expectations.
- **Files:** `docs/llm_agents/IMPLEMENTATION_LLM_Agent_Code_Architecture.md`, `docs/llm_agents/SYNC_LLM_Agents_State.md`
- **Verification:** `ngram validate` *(fails: existing connectome health doc gaps plus naming/CHAIN warnings noted by doctor)*

## KNOWN ISSUES

No confirmed defects are tracked; the stderr model listing noise is
noted in handoff context and has not been triaged yet.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Your likely VIEW:** `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md`

**Where I stopped:** Documentation only; no behavior changes.

**What you need to understand:**
The Gemini adapter is a thin wrapper intended to isolate provider SDK usage. It streams JSON chunks for the TUI and supports basic local tool execution. The default model is `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

**Watch out for:**
The adapter prints model listings to stderr unconditionally; consider gating if that output is noisy.

**Open questions I had:**
Should we standardize adapter helpers for streaming JSON and error handling?

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
LLM agent docs now exist for the Gemini adapter, with module mapping and a DOCS pointer added.

**Decisions made:**
Documented the module as DESIGNING and kept the chain minimal (PATTERNS + SYNC).

**Needs your input:**
None.

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Mental state when stopping:**
Calm, focused on minimal documentation to satisfy mapping requirements.

**Threads I was holding:**
Whether to document the stderr model listing as a known issue and whether to add more doc chain files.

**Intuitions:**
A shared adapter helper will likely appear once a second provider is added.

**What I wish I'd known at the start:**
That only the Gemini adapter exists, so the docs should stay lean.

---

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- Added SCOPE and DATA sections to the provider adapter PATTERNS doc to resolve template drift.
- Added missing template sections (SCOPE/DATA) to the provider subprocess patterns doc.
- Documented BEHAVIORS SUPPORTED and BEHAVIORS PREVENTED in the provider subprocess PATTERNS doc to describe allowed and blocked flows.
- Filled missing template sections in the Gemini behaviors doc to document inputs, outputs, and edge cases.
- Gemini tool stubs were replaced with real filesystem/web handlers and light persistence.
- Google search base URL is now configurable via `NGRAM_GOOGLE_SEARCH_URL`.
- Expanded short SYNC sections to satisfy template length requirements.
- Documented the Gemini objectives and I/O story so the behaviors template is fully compliant again.
- Formalized the Gemini validation guarantees/objectives tables so the doctor no longer reports drift and the sections exceed the required length threshold.
- Expanded the Gemini implementation doc with code-structure, state, and runtime sections to close its DOC_TEMPLATE_DRIFT warning.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Add automated tests for tool outputs (tool_code/tool_result JSON).

### Propositions
- Consider a shared tool helper module if additional providers are added.

## POINTERS

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Gemini adapter | `ngram/llms/gemini_agent.py` |
| CLI integration | `ngram/agent_cli.py` |


---

## TODO

- [ ] Capture telemetry for LLM adapters (usage counts, errors, sync updates) so doctor can surface trends and the SYNC reflects real-world load.
