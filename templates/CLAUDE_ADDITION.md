# ngram CLAUDE.md Template

**Note:** This file is for reference only. The actual CLAUDE.md content is built
programmatically by `init_cmd.py`, which inlines the full content of PRINCIPLES.md
and PROTOCOL.md directly (since Claude doesn't expand @ references).

The generated CLAUDE.md includes:
1. Full PRINCIPLES.md content (inlined)
2. Full PROTOCOL.md content (inlined)
3. Quick reference for VIEWs and SYNC files

See `ngram/init_cmd.py:_build_claude_addition()` for the actual template.
