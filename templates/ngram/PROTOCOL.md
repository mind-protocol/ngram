**You are an AI agent working on code. This document explains the protocol and why it exists.**

---

## WHY THIS PROTOCOL EXISTS

You have a limited context window. You can't load everything. But you need:
- The right context for your current task
- To not lose state between sessions
- To not hallucinate structure that doesn't exist

This protocol solves these problems through:
1. **VIEWs** — Task-specific context loading instructions
2. **Documentation chains** — Bidirectional links between code and docs
3. **SYNC files** — Explicit state tracking for handoffs

---

## COMPANION: PRINCIPLES.md

This file (PROTOCOL.md) tells you **what to load and where to update**.

PRINCIPLES.md tells you **how to work** — the stance to hold:
- Architecture: One solution per problem
- Verification: Test before claiming built
- Communication: Depth over brevity
- Quality: Never degrade

Read PRINCIPLES.md and internalize it. Then use this file for navigation.

---

## THE CORE INSIGHT

Documentation isn't an archive. It's navigation.

Every module has a chain: OBJECTIVES → BEHAVIORS → PATTERNS → ALGORITHM → VALIDATION → IMPLEMENTATION → HEALTH → SYNC.
Each file explains something different. You load what you need for your task.

SYNC files track current state. They're how you understand what's happening and how you communicate to the next agent (or yourself in a future session).

---

## HOW TO USE THIS

### 1. Check State First

```
.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md
```

Understand what's happening, what changed recently, any handoffs for you.

### 2. Choose Your VIEW

VIEWs are organized by product development lifecycle. Pick the one matching your stage:

**Understanding & Planning:**
- `views/VIEW_Ingest_Process_Raw_Data_Sources.md` — processing raw data (chats, PDFs, research)
- `views/VIEW_Onboard_Understand_Existing_Codebase.md` — getting oriented
- `views/VIEW_Analyze_Structural_Analysis.md` — analyzing structure, recommending improvements
- `views/VIEW_Specify_Design_Vision_And_Architecture.md` — defining what to build

**Building:**
- `views/VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` — writing code
- `views/VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md` — adding to existing modules
- `views/VIEW_Collaborate_Pair_Program_With_Human.md` — real-time work with human

**Verifying:**
- `views/VIEW_Health_Define_Health_Checks_And_Verify.md` — defining health checks
- `views/VIEW_Debug_Investigate_And_Fix_Issues.md` — fixing problems
- `views/VIEW_Review_Evaluate_Changes.md` — evaluating changes

**Maintaining:**
- `views/VIEW_Refactor_Improve_Code_Structure.md` — improving without changing behavior
- `views/VIEW_Document_Create_Module_Documentation.md` — documenting existing modules

### 3. Load Your VIEW

The VIEW explains what context to load and why. It's tailored to your task.

### 4. Do Your Work

Use the context. Make your changes. Hold the principles.

### 5. Update State

After changes, update SYNC files:
- What you did and why
- Current state
- Handoffs for next agent or human

## FILE TYPES AND THEIR PURPOSE

### The Documentation Chain

| Pattern | Purpose | When to Load |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `OBJECTIVES_*.md` | Ranked goals & tradeoffs — WHAT we optimize | Before deciding tradeoffs |
| `PATTERNS_*.md` | Design philosophy & scope — WHY this shape, WHAT's in/out | Before modifying module |
| `BEHAVIORS_*.md` | Observable effects — WHAT it should do | When behavior unclear |
| `ALGORITHM_*.md` | Procedures — HOW it works (pseudocode) | When logic unclear |
| `VALIDATION_*.md` | Invariants — WHAT must be true | Before implementing |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_*.md` | Code architecture — WHERE code lives, data flows | When building or navigating code |
| `HEALTH_*.md` | Health checks — WHAT's verified in practice | When defining health signals |
| `SYNC_*.md` | Current state — WHERE we are | Always |

### Cross-Cutting Documentation

| Pattern | Purpose | When to Load |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `CONCEPT_*.md` | Cross-cutting idea — WHAT it means | When concept spans modules |
| `TOUCHES_*.md` | Index — WHERE concept appears | Finding related code |

## KEY PRINCIPLES (from PRINCIPLES.md)

**Docs Before Code**
Understand before changing. The docs exist so you don't have to reverse-engineer intent.

**State Is Explicit**
Don't assume the next agent knows what you know. Write it down in SYNC.

**Handoffs Have Recipients**
Specify who they're for: which VIEW will the next agent use? Is there a human summary needed?

**Proof Over Assertion**
Don't claim things work. Show how to verify. Link to tests. Provide evidence.

**One Solution Per Problem**
Before creating, verify it doesn't exist. Fix, don't circumvent. Delete obsolete versions.

## STRUCTURING YOUR DOCS

### Areas and Modules

The `docs/` directory has two levels of organization:

```
docs/
├── {area}/              # Optional grouping (backend, frontend, infra...)
│   └── {module}/        # Specific component with its doc chain
└── {module}/            # Or modules directly at root if no areas needed
```

**Module** = A cohesive piece of functionality with its own design decisions.
Examples: `auth`, `payments`, `event-store`, `cli`, `api-gateway`

**Area** = A logical grouping of related modules.
Examples: `backend`, `frontend`, `infrastructure`, `services`

### When to Use Areas

**Use areas when:**
- You have 5+ modules and need organization
- Modules naturally cluster (all backend services, all UI components)
- Different teams own different areas

**Skip areas when:**
- Small project with few modules
- Flat structure is clearer
- You're just starting out

### How to Identify Modules

A module should have:
- **Clear boundaries** — You can say what's in and what's out
- **Design decisions** — There are choices worth documenting (why this approach?)
- **Cohesive purpose** — It does one thing (even if complex)

**Good modules:**
- `auth` — handles authentication and authorization
- `event-sourcing` — the event store and projection system
- `billing` — subscription and payment logic

**Too granular:**
- `login-button` — just a component, part of `auth` or `ui`
- `user-model` — just a file, part of `users` module

**Too broad:**
- `backend` — that's an area, not a module
- `everything` — meaningless boundary

### Concepts vs Modules

Some ideas span multiple modules. Use `docs/concepts/` for these:

```
docs/concepts/
└── event-sourcing/
    ├── CONCEPT_Event_Sourcing_Fundamentals.md
    └── TOUCHES_Event_Sourcing_Locations.md
```

The TOUCHES file lists where the concept appears in code — which modules implement it.

### Starting Fresh

If you're initializing on a new project:

1. **Don't create docs upfront** — Let them emerge as you build
2. **First module** — When you make your first design decision worth preserving, create its docs
3. **Add areas later** — When you have enough modules that organization helps

If you're initializing on an existing project:

1. **Identify 2-3 core modules** — What are the main components?
2. **Start with PATTERNS + SYNC** — Minimum viable docs
3. **Use VIEW_Document** — For systematic documentation of each module

---

## WHEN DOCS DON'T EXIST

Create them. Use templates in `templates/`.

At minimum, create:
- PATTERNS (why this module exists, what design approach)
- SYNC (current state, even if "just created")

But first — check if they already exist somewhere. Architecture principle.

**A doc with questions is better than no doc.**

An empty template is useless. But a PATTERNS file that captures open questions, initial ideas, and "here's what we're thinking" is valuable. The bar isn't "finished thinking" — it's "captured thinking."

---

## THE DOCUMENTATION PROCESS

### When to Create Docs

**The trigger is a decision or discovery.**

You're building. You hit a fork. You choose. That choice is a PATTERNS moment.

Or: you implement something and realize "oh, *this* is how it actually works." That's an ALGORITHM moment.

Document when you have something worth capturing — a decision, an insight, a question worth preserving.

### Top-Down and Bottom-Up

Documentation flows both directions:

**Top-down:** Design decision → PATTERNS → Implementation → Code
- "We'll use a weighted graph because..." → build it

**Bottom-up:** Code → Discovery → PATTERNS
- Build something → realize "oh, this constraint matters" → document why

Both are valid. Sometimes you know the pattern before coding. Sometimes the code teaches you the pattern. Capture it either way.

### Maturity Tracking

**Every doc and module has a maturity state. Track it in SYNC.**

| State | Meaning | What Belongs Here |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `CANONICAL` | Stable, shipped, v1 | Core design decisions, working behavior |
| `DESIGNING` | In progress, not final | Current thinking, open questions, draft decisions |
| `PROPOSED` | Future version idea | v2 features, improvements, "someday" ideas |
| `DEPRECATED` | Being phased out | Old approaches being replaced |

**In SYNC files, be explicit:**

```markdown
## Maturity

STATUS: DESIGNING

What's canonical (v1):
- Graph structure with typed edges
- Weight propagation algorithm

What's still being designed:
- Cycle detection strategy
- Performance optimization

What's proposed (v2):
- Real-time weight updates
- Distributed graph support
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents scope creep — v2 ideas don't sneak into v1
- Clarifies what's stable vs experimental
- Helps agents know what they can rely on vs what might change

### The Pruning Cycle

**Periodically: cut the non-essential. Refocus.**

As you build, ideas accumulate. Some are essential. Some seemed important but aren't. Some are distractions.

The protocol includes a refocus practice:

1. **Review SYNC files** — What's marked PROPOSED that should be cut?
2. **Check scope** — Is v1 still focused? Or has it grown?
3. **Prune** — Move non-essential to a "future.md" or delete
4. **Refocus PATTERNS** — Does the design rationale still hold?

**When to prune:**
- Before major milestones
- When feeling overwhelmed by scope
- When SYNC files are getting cluttered
- When you notice drift between docs and reality

**The question to ask:** "If we shipped today, what actually matters?"

Everything else is v2 (or noise).

## NAMING ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES

Code and documentation files are written for agents first, so their naming must make focus and responsibility explicit.
Follow the language's default casing (`snake_case.py` for Python) but use the name itself to point at the entity, the processing responsibility,
and the pattern. Include the work being done ("parser", "runner", "validator") or use a verb phrase, for example `prompt_quality_validator`,
so the agent understands focus immediately.

- When a file embodies multiple responsibilities, list them explicitly in the name (e.g., `doctor_cli_parser_and_run_checker.py`).
  The split should be obvious before the file is opened, signalling whether splitting or rerouting is needed.
- Hint at the processing style instead of being vague (e.g., `semantic_proximity_based_character_node_selector.py`)
  so agents understand both what and how without needing extra context.
- Keep filenames long—25 to 75 characters—longer than typical human-led repos, to make responsibility boundaries explicit at
  a glance and help agents locate the right file with minimal digging.

This naming approach reduces ambiguity, surfaces when refactors are necessary, and lets agents land on the correct implementation faster with less state.

## THE PROTOCOL IS A TOOL

You're intelligent. You understand context and nuance. 

This protocol isn't a cage — it's a tool. It helps you:
- Find relevant context quickly
- Communicate effectively across sessions
- Not waste tokens on irrelevant information

Use it in the spirit it's intended: to make your work better.

The principles in PRINCIPLES.md are what good work feels like. The navigation in this file is how to find what you need.
