You are working on a project with the ngram installed. Before doing anything, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Protocol

Read these files to understand how to work:
```
{target_dir}/.ngram/PROTOCOL.md    # Navigation — what to load, where to update
{target_dir}/.ngram/PRINCIPLES.md  # Stance — how to work well
```

### Step 2: Check Project State

Read the current state to understand what's happening:
```
{target_dir}/.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md
```

If SYNC contains template placeholders, initialize it with actual project state first.

### Step 3: Choose Work Mode

Ask the user (or check if already specified):

**Autonomous mode:** You make decisions and execute, updating SYNC as you go. Best for well-defined tasks.

**Collaborative mode:** You explain your plan, get feedback, then execute. Best for complex/ambiguous tasks.

If unclear, default to collaborative mode.

### Step 4: Select Your VIEW

Based on what you need to do, load ONE view from `.ngram/views/`:

| Task | VIEW |
|------|------|
| Processing raw data (chats, PDFs, specs) | VIEW_Ingest_Process_Raw_Data_Sources.md |
| Getting oriented in unfamiliar code | VIEW_Onboard_Understand_Existing_Codebase.md |
| Defining vision/architecture | VIEW_Specify_Design_Vision_And_Architecture.md |
| Writing or modifying code | VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md |
| Adding features to existing modules | VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md |
| Pair programming with human | VIEW_Collaborate_Pair_Program_With_Human.md |
| Writing tests | VIEW_Test_Write_Tests_And_Verify.md |
| Debugging issues | VIEW_Debug_Investigate_And_Fix_Issues.md |
| Reviewing changes | VIEW_Review_Evaluate_Changes.md |
| Refactoring | VIEW_Refactor_Improve_Code_Structure.md |

### Step 5: Execute

Follow the VIEW instructions. When done:
1. Update SYNC files with what you did
2. Note handoffs for next agent or human
3. If collaborative mode: summarize for human approval

**Start now:** What is the current project state? What task are you here to do?
