# MODULE MANIFEST
# =============================================================================
#
# This file maps code to documentation and carries rich context about each module.
#
# WHEN TO UPDATE:
# - Creating new code directories → add module mapping
# - Creating new doc modules → add mapping
# - Refactoring/moving code → update patterns
# - Changing module maturity → update status
#
# VALIDATION:
# `ngram validate` warns about unmapped code directories.
