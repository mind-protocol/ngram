# MODULE MANIFEST
# =============================================================================
#
# This file maps code to documentation and carries rich context about each module.
#
# WHEN TO UPDATE:
# - Creating new code directories → add module mapping
# - Creating new doc modules → add mapping
# - Refactoring/moving code → update patterns
# - Changing module maturity → update status
#
# VALIDATION:
# `ngram validate` warns about unmapped code directories.

    notes: |
      The Textual User Interface for interacting with ngram.
      `ngram/tui/app_core.py` remains above the monolith threshold; further extraction needed.
