# Project — Sync: Current State

```
LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-18
UPDATED_BY: repair-agent

---

## CURRENT STATE

The Context Protocol project is functional and in active use. The CLI provides commands for initializing, validating, diagnosing, and repairing protocol compliance in any project.

Documentation coverage is complete. The `src/` directory containing the CLI implementation has proper module documentation mapped in `modules.yaml`.

## ACTIVE WORK

None currently.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-18: Fixed Broken Implementation Links

- **What:** Fixed BROKEN_IMPL_LINK issue in `docs/protocol/IMPLEMENTATION_Protocol_Code_Architecture.md`
- **Why:** Doctor reported 27 non-existent file references (filenames extracted from tree diagrams without path context)
- **Impact:** All file references in IMPLEMENTATION doc now resolve to existing files

Files modified:
- `docs/protocol/IMPLEMENTATION_Protocol_Code_Architecture.md` — Updated file structure documentation to use full project-relative paths
- `docs/protocol/SYNC_Protocol_Current_State.md` — Updated with changes

**Fix approach:**
- Tree diagrams now use filename-only entries (no extensions) with a companion table listing full paths
- Removed backticked paths starting with `.` (validator strips leading dots, breaking path resolution)
- All 24 remaining file references validated as resolvable

### 2025-12-18: Completed Protocol Module Documentation Chain

- **What:** Created IMPLEMENTATION_Protocol_Code_Architecture.md for `docs/protocol/` module
- **Why:** Doctor reported INCOMPLETE_CHAIN — protocol module was missing IMPLEMENTATION doc
- **Impact:** Protocol module now has complete 7-doc chain (PATTERNS, BEHAVIORS, ALGORITHM, VALIDATION, IMPLEMENTATION, TEST, SYNC)

Files created:
- `docs/protocol/IMPLEMENTATION_Protocol_Code_Architecture.md` — Documents file structure, data flows, and agent traversal patterns

Files updated:
- `docs/protocol/SYNC_Protocol_Current_State.md` — Updated with recent changes

### 2025-12-18: Completed CLI Documentation Chain

- **What:** Created 5 missing doc types for `docs/cli/` module
- **Why:** Doctor reported INCOMPLETE_CHAIN — module had only PATTERNS + SYNC
- **Impact:** CLI module now has full 7-doc chain (PATTERNS, BEHAVIORS, ALGORITHM, VALIDATION, IMPLEMENTATION, TEST, SYNC)

Files created:
- `docs/cli/BEHAVIORS_CLI_Command_Effects.md` — Observable command behaviors
- `docs/cli/ALGORITHM_CLI_Logic.md` — Command processing logic
- `docs/cli/VALIDATION_CLI_Invariants.md` — Invariants and checks
- `docs/cli/IMPLEMENTATION_CLI_Code_Architecture.md` — Code structure
- `docs/cli/TEST_CLI_Coverage.md` — Test coverage (currently 0%)

Files updated:
- `docs/cli/PATTERNS_Why_CLI_Over_Copy.md` — Updated CHAIN section
- `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md` — Added CHAIN section, updated to CANONICAL

### 2025-12-18: Fixed modules.yaml indentation

- **What:** Fixed YAML indentation so `context-protocol-cli` module is properly nested under `modules:` key
- **Why:** Doctor reported UNDOCUMENTED issue because the module entry was at root level, not under `modules:`
- **Impact:** Module mapping now parses correctly, UNDOCUMENTED issue resolved

Files modified:
- `modules.yaml` — Fixed indentation (module entry was at root level instead of under `modules:`)

### 2025-12-18: CLI Module Documentation

- **What:** Documented the `src/context_protocol/` module
- **Why:** Doctor reported UNDOCUMENTED issue for src/ (12 files without docs)
- **Impact:** Module is now mapped in modules.yaml, has PATTERNS explaining design, SYNC tracking state

Files created/modified:
- `modules.yaml` — Added context-protocol-cli module mapping
- `docs/cli/PATTERNS_Why_CLI_Over_Copy.md` — Design rationale
- `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md` — Current state
- `src/context_protocol/cli.py` — Updated DOCS: reference

## KNOWN ISSUES

| Issue | Severity | Area | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Parallel output interleaving | low | repair.py | Agent outputs can mix when running parallel repairs |

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Likely VIEW for continuing:** `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md`

**Current focus:** Project health and documentation coverage

**Key context:**
The CLI is the main deliverable. Understanding `repair.py` is important for working on automated fixes. Each CLI command lives in its own file under `src/context_protocol/`.

**Watch out for:**
- Templates live in `templates/` at repo root (development) OR inside the package (installed)
- YAML is optional — code handles missing yaml library gracefully

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
The src/ directory is now documented. Created module mapping and minimum viable docs (PATTERNS + SYNC). CLI health issue resolved.

**Decisions made recently:**
- Named module `context-protocol-cli` in modules.yaml
- Put docs in flat `docs/cli/` structure (no area nesting)

**Needs your input:**
- None currently

**Concerns:**
- None

---

## TODO

### High Priority

- [x] Document src/ module (UNDOCUMENTED issue)
- [x] Complete CLI documentation chain (INCOMPLETE_CHAIN issue)

### Backlog

- [ ] Add automated tests for CLI (currently 0% coverage)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD test pipeline
- IDEA: Add watch mode for continuous health monitoring

## AREAS

| Area | Status | SYNC |
|------|--------|------|
| `docs/cli/` | documented | `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md` |
| `docs/protocol/` | documented | `docs/protocol/SYNC_Protocol_Current_State.md` |

---

## MODULE COVERAGE

Check `modules.yaml` for full manifest.

**Mapped modules:**
| Module | Code | Docs | Maturity |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| context-protocol-cli | `src/context_protocol/**` | `docs/cli/` | CANONICAL |

**Unmapped code:** None after this repair

**Coverage notes:**
The CLI module is the main code in this project. Templates are not mapped as they're static resources, not code.
