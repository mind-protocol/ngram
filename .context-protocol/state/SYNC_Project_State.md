# Project — Sync: Current State

## CURRENT STATE

The Context Protocol project is functional and in active use. The CLI provides commands for initializing, validating, diagnosing, and repairing protocol compliance in any project.

Recent focus has been on documentation coverage. The `src/` directory containing the CLI implementation now has proper module documentation mapped in `modules.yaml`.

---

## ACTIVE WORK

### Documentation Coverage

- **Area:** `docs/cli/`
- **Status:** completed
- **Owner:** repair-agent
- **Context:** The src/ directory had 12 Python files with no documentation mapping. Created PATTERNS and SYNC docs.

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-18: CLI Module Documentation

- **What:** Documented the `src/context_protocol/` module
- **Why:** Doctor reported UNDOCUMENTED issue for src/ (12 files without docs)
- **Impact:** Module is now mapped in modules.yaml, has PATTERNS explaining design, SYNC tracking state

Files created/modified:
- `modules.yaml` — Added context-protocol-cli module mapping
- `docs/cli/PATTERNS_Why_CLI_Over_Copy.md` — Design rationale
- `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md` — Current state
- `src/context_protocol/cli.py` — Updated DOCS: reference

## KNOWN ISSUES

| Issue | Severity | Area | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Parallel output interleaving | low | repair.py | Agent outputs can mix when running parallel repairs |

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Likely VIEW for continuing:** `VIEW_Extend_Add_Features_To_Existing.md`

**Current focus:** Project health and documentation coverage

**Key context:**
The CLI is the main deliverable. Understanding `repair.py` is important for working on automated fixes. Each CLI command lives in its own file under `src/context_protocol/`.

**Watch out for:**
- Templates live in `templates/` at repo root (development) OR inside the package (installed)
- YAML is optional — code handles missing yaml library gracefully

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
The src/ directory is now documented. Created module mapping and minimum viable docs (PATTERNS + SYNC). CLI health issue resolved.

**Decisions made recently:**
- Named module `context-protocol-cli` in modules.yaml
- Put docs in flat `docs/cli/` structure (no area nesting)

**Needs your input:**
- None currently

**Concerns:**
- None

---

## TODO

### High Priority

- [x] Document src/ module (UNDOCUMENTED issue)

### Backlog

- [ ] Create IMPLEMENTATION doc for CLI with file structure details
- [ ] Consider adding BEHAVIORS doc for command specifications
- IDEA: Add watch mode for continuous health monitoring

---

## AREAS

| Area | Status | SYNC |
|------|--------|------|
| `docs/cli/` | documented | `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md` |

---

## MODULE COVERAGE

Check `modules.yaml` for full manifest.

**Mapped modules:**
| Module | Code | Docs | Maturity |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| context-protocol-cli | `src/context_protocol/**` | `docs/cli/` | DESIGNING |

**Unmapped code:** None after this repair

**Coverage notes:**
The CLI module is the main code in this project. Templates are not mapped as they're static resources, not code.
