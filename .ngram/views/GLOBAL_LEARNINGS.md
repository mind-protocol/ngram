# Global Learnings

**Project-wide guidance that applies to ALL agents, regardless of their current VIEW.**

These learnings are captured from repair sessions and human feedback. They represent patterns, preferences, and constraints that should always be followed.

## Learnings

### 2025-12-19: No reintroductions
Don't introduce yourself at the start of each session. The user knows who you are. Just get to work or respond directly.

### 2025-12-19: Never downgrade functionality without permission
When fixing bugs or layout issues, do not remove existing features as a shortcut. If a feature (like copy buttons) is causing problems, fix the feature — don't delete it. Always ask before removing functionality, even if the removal "simplifies" the code.

### 2025-12-19: Parallel work is expected; never revert commits
Do not revert commits or stop work just because there are concurrent changes. Parallel edits are normal here; keep going unless the user explicitly asks you to stop.
