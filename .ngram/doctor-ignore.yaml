    False positive - get_agent_color, get_agent_symbol, color are intentionally
    simple one-line utility functions. They provide semantic meaning to common
    operations (color lookup, symbol cycling, ANSI wrapping). Short body != incomplete.

    False positive - get_issue_symbol, get_issue_action_parts are intentionally
    simple one-liner dictionary lookup functions with sensible defaults.
    They return tuples from ISSUE_SYMBOLS and ISSUE_DESCRIPTIONS respectively.
    Used throughout repair.py for display formatting. Short body != incomplete.

  reason: >-
    False positive - 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' is the W3C standard SVG namespace URI,
    not a configurable URL. This is a fixed specification constant required for creating
    SVG elements in JavaScript/DOM. It cannot be changed and is not configuration.
    Similar to SQL keywords - it's part of the standard, not an endpoint.
