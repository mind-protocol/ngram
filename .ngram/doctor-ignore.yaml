# Doctor Ignore Configuration
#
# This file lists issues that should be suppressed by `ngram doctor`.
# Use this for verified false positives or intentional exceptions.
#
# Each entry requires:
#   - issue_type: The issue type to suppress (e.g., MONOLITH, HARDCODED_SECRET)
#   - path: File/directory path or glob pattern (e.g., src/legacy/*, tests/**)
#   - reason: Explanation of why this is being ignored (for audit trail)
#
# Optional fields:
#   - added_by: Who added this entry (agent name, human, etc.)
#   - added_date: When added (YYYY-MM-DD)
#
# Example entries:
#
# ignores:
#   - issue_type: MONOLITH
#     path: src/generated/schema.py
#     reason: Auto-generated file, splitting not practical
#     added_by: human
#     added_date: 2025-01-15
#
#   - issue_type: HARDCODED_SECRET
#     path: tests/fixtures/**
#     reason: Test fixtures use fake credentials
#     added_by: agent
#     added_date: 2025-01-15
#
#   - issue_type: MAGIC_VALUES
#     path: src/constants.py
#     reason: This IS the constants file
#     added_by: human
#     added_date: 2025-01-15
#
# Pattern matching:
#   - Exact: "src/file.py" matches only that file
#   - Glob: "tests/**" matches all files under tests/
#   - Wildcard: "*" with issue_type suppresses ALL issues of that type (use sparingly)

    reason: |
      False positive - references to .ngram/CLAUDE.md are correct but doctor's
      extract_impl_file_refs() strips leading dots (line 294: ref.lstrip('./'))
      causing .ngram/ paths to become ngram/ which doesn't exist.
      Doctor bug tracked - the doc references are valid.

  - issue_type: INCOMPLETE_IMPL
    path: src/ngram/repair.py
    reason: |
      False positive for get_agent_color and get_agent_symbol functions.
      These are complete one-liner utility functions that index into color/symbol
      arrays. File contains explicit comment at lines 47-50 stating these are
      "intentionally simple one-line utility functions" and "Short body does not
      mean incomplete". Doctor's empty function detection incorrectly flags
      single-line implementations.

  - issue_type: INCOMPLETE_IMPL
    path: src/ngram/repair_core.py
    reason: |
      False positive for get_issue_symbol and get_issue_action_parts functions.
      These are complete one-liner dictionary lookups with sensible defaults.
      Short body does not mean incomplete - they are working implementations
      used throughout the codebase.

  - issue_type: INCOMPLETE_IMPL
    path: src/ngram/tui/app.py
    reason: |
      False positive - the flagged functions are implemented, just short:
      - _startup_sequence: Awaits two method calls (doctor check + manager overview)
      - on_claude_output: Nested callback that adds messages to panel
      - _build_manager_overview_prompt: Returns multi-line string prompt
      - on_click: Focuses input bar (2 statements)
      - on_exception: Calls log_error (1 statement, intentionally minimal)
      - action_doctor: Awaits _run_doctor (delegating method)
      - action_repair: Awaits handle_command (delegating method)
      These are legitimate short methods, not incomplete implementations.
      Doctor bug: threshold of ≤2 lines is too aggressive for delegating methods.
