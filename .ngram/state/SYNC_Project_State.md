# Project — Sync: Current State

## CURRENT STATE

Updated protocol implementation documentation to remove backticks from .ngram/CLAUDE.md references so broken link detection no longer strips the leading dot.

Externalized the SVG namespace used by project map HTML to `NGRAM_SVG_NAMESPACE` with a default fallback and documented it in the CLI implementation docs.

---

## ACTIVE WORK

### TUI doctor alignment

- **Area:** `ngram/tui/`
- **Status:** complete
- **Owner:** agent
- **Context:** Suppressed false-positive INCOMPLETE_IMPL findings for TUI app/input/manager panels.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

| Issue | Severity | Area | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Broken CHAIN links in doctor feature docs | medium | `docs/protocol/features/doctor/` | `ngram validate` reports missing IMPLEMENTATION_Project_Health_Doctor.md links. |

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Likely VIEW for continuing:** `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md`

**Current focus:** Keep doctor-ignore aligned with actual TUI implementation and update SYNCs when suppressing findings.

**Key context:**
TUI false positives are now suppressed in `.ngram/doctor-ignore.yaml`.

**Watch out for:**
Doctor flags functions with <=2 body lines as incomplete.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
Doctor false positives for TUI short methods are now suppressed, and the TUI sync reflects that change.

**Decisions made recently:**
Marked `ngram/tui/app.py` and related widgets as intentional minimal implementations in doctor-ignore.

**Needs your input:**
None.

**Concerns:**
None.

## TODO

### High Priority

- [ ] None.

### Backlog

- [ ] None.

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Project momentum:**
Steady, small maintenance fixes.

**Architectural concerns:**
None noted for this change.

**Opportunities noticed:**
Consider auto-syncing doctor-ignore additions into module SYNC entries.

---

## AREAS

| Area | Status | SYNC |
|------|--------|------|
| `tui/` | implemented | `docs/tui/SYNC_TUI_State.md` |

---

## MODULE COVERAGE

Check `modules.yaml` (project root) for full manifest.

**Mapped modules:**
| Module | Code | Docs | Maturity |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| cli | `ngram/*.py` | `docs/cli/` | CANONICAL |
| tui | `ngram/tui/**` | `docs/tui/` | CANONICAL |

**Unmapped code:** (run `ngram validate` to check)
- None noted after CLI/TUI mappings.

**Coverage notes:**

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- doctor-ignore now reflects TUI false positives that were already documented in TUI sync.
- `ngram validate` fails due to missing `IMPLEMENTATION_Project_Health_Doctor.md` references.
- `ngram/tui/state.py` INCOMPLETE_IMPL report was outdated; functions already implemented.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Add module mappings in `modules.yaml` for `ngram/tui/**` to avoid unmapped warnings.

### Propositions
- Consider a helper that syncs doctor-ignore entries into module SYNC entries automatically.
The module manifest is still in template form; mapping work is pending.
