## CURRENT STATE

ngram CLI project with doctor/repair functionality for maintaining project health.

---

## ACTIVE WORK

### Monolith Refactoring

- **Area:** `src/ngram/`
- **Status:** completed
- **Owner:** repair-agent
- **Context:** Reducing file sizes to meet 800-line threshold

---

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-18: Split doctor_checks.py monolith

- **What:** Extracted 7 functions from doctor_checks.py into 2 new files:
  - `doctor_checks_quality.py` (172L): doctor_check_magic_values, doctor_check_hardcoded_secrets
  - `doctor_checks_docs.py` (316L): doctor_check_placeholder_docs, doctor_check_orphan_docs, doctor_check_stale_impl, doctor_check_large_doc_module, doctor_check_incomplete_chain
- **Why:** MONOLITH issue - file was 1155 lines (threshold: 800)
- **Impact:** doctor_checks.py reduced from 1155 lines to 733 lines (now under threshold). Functions are re-exported for backwards compatibility.
- **Doc updates:** modules.yaml updated with cli module mapping including new files.

### 2025-12-18: Split repair_instructions.py monolith

- **What:** Removed duplicate doc-related instructions from repair_instructions.py that were already extracted to repair_instructions_docs.py. Updated get_issue_instructions() to delegate to get_doc_instructions() for doc-related issues.
- **Why:** MONOLITH issue - file was 1226 lines (threshold: 800)
- **Impact:** repair_instructions.py reduced from 1226 lines to 765 lines (WATCH status). repair_instructions_docs.py remains at 492 lines. Total 1257 lines split across 2 files.
- **Doc updates:** IMPLEMENTATION_CLI_Code_Architecture.md updated with new file structure, file responsibilities, and dependency diagram.

### 2025-12-18: Remove duplicate code from repair.py

- **What:** Removed ~270 lines of duplicate code from repair.py that was already defined in repair_interactive.py. Functions removed: print_progress_bar, input_listener_thread, spawn_manager_agent, check_for_manager_input, resolve_arbitrage_interactive, and associated global state variables.
- **Why:** MONOLITH issue - file was 983 lines (threshold: 800)
- **Impact:** repair.py reduced from 983 lines to 712 lines. Code now properly uses imports from repair_interactive.py instead of shadowing them with local duplicates.

### 2025-12-18: Verified repair_core.py functions as complete (false positive)

- **What:** Verified that `get_issue_symbol` and `get_issue_action_parts` in `repair_core.py` are already implemented correctly.
- **Why:** INCOMPLETE_IMPL issue flagged these as empty, but they are complete one-liner dictionary lookups with sensible defaults.
- **Impact:** No code changes needed. Functions return correct tuples used throughout the codebase.
- **Note:** Doctor's empty function detection may flag single-line implementations as incomplete.

### 2025-12-18: Verified repair.py functions as complete (false positive)

- **What:** Verified that `get_agent_color` and `get_agent_symbol` in `repair.py` are already implemented correctly.
- **Why:** INCOMPLETE_IMPL issue flagged these as empty, but they are complete one-liner implementations.
- **Impact:** No code changes needed. Functions correctly index into `Colors.AGENT_COLORS` and `AGENT_SYMBOLS` constants.
- **Note:** File contains explicit comment at lines 47-50 stating these are "intentionally simple one-line utility functions" and "Short body does not mean incomplete".

## KNOWN ISSUES

| Issue | Severity | Area | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| INCOMPLETE_IMPL false positives | info | `src/ngram/` | Doctor flags one-liner functions as "empty". Files have explanatory comments. Consider improving empty function detection heuristics. |
