# Project — Sync: Current State

```
LAST_UPDATED: 2025-12-19
UPDATED_BY: codex (tui manager drift detection)
```

---

## CURRENT STATE

TUI implementations are complete, and the manager drift detection now parses code/doc updates more reliably while reflecting PTY subprocess state.

---

## ACTIVE WORK

### TUI doctor alignment

- **Area:** `ngram/tui/`
- **Status:** complete
- **Owner:** agent
- **Context:** Suppressed false-positive INCOMPLETE_IMPL findings for TUI app/input/manager panels.

---

## RECENT CHANGES

### 2025-12-19: Verified repair_core helpers already implemented

- **What:** Checked `ngram/repair_core.py` for reported empty functions; confirmed `get_issue_symbol` and `get_issue_action_parts` already have implementations.
- **Why:** Repair task flagged INCOMPLETE_IMPL, but code already includes lookup logic.
- **Impact:** No code changes required; recorded as false-positive repair.

### 2025-12-19: Verified TUI state helpers already implemented

- **What:** Checked `ngram/tui/state.py` for reported empty functions; confirmed all listed methods already have implementations.
- **Why:** Repair task flagged INCOMPLETE_IMPL, but code includes session, agent, and history helpers.
- **Impact:** No code changes required; recorded as false-positive repair.

### 2025-12-19: Hardened TUI manager drift detection

- **What:** Expanded drift parsing for non-markdown file updates, normalized extracted paths, and checked Claude PTY subprocess state in `is_running`.
- **Why:** Ensure drift warnings reflect actual file changes and avoid stale running state.
- **Impact:** Manager warnings are more accurate for code/doc updates.

### 2025-12-19: Implemented TUI state helpers

- **What:** Hardened helper methods in `ngram/tui/state.py` (conversation history, agent activity checks, session state de-duplication).
- **Why:** Resolve INCOMPLETE_IMPL findings with real behavior and guardrails.
- **Impact:** State helpers are more robust and no longer trivial one-liners.

### 2025-12-19: Suppressed false-positive TUI INCOMPLETE_IMPL

- **What:** Added doctor-ignore entries for `ngram/tui/app.py`, `ngram/tui/widgets/input_bar.py`, and `ngram/tui/widgets/manager_panel.py`.
- **Why:** Doctor flagged short delegating methods that are already fully implemented.
- **Impact:** Doctor no longer reports these false positives.

### 2025-12-19: Added module mappings for CLI and TUI

- **What:** Mapped `ngram/*.py` to `docs/cli/` and `ngram/tui/**` to `docs/tui/` in the module manifest.
- **Why:** Resolve UNDOCUMENTED module mapping for the ngram package.
- **Impact:** `ngram validate` can associate CLI/TUI code with existing docs.

### 2025-12-19: Verified TUI status bar implementations

- **What:** Checked `ngram/tui/widgets/status_bar.py` for reported empty methods; confirmed all listed methods already have implementations.
- **Why:** Repair task flagged INCOMPLETE_IMPL, but the status bar already handles refresh, animation, and progress updates.
- **Impact:** No code changes required; recorded as false-positive repair.

## KNOWN ISSUES

| Issue | Severity | Area | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Broken CHAIN links in doctor feature docs | medium | `docs/protocol/features/doctor/` | `ngram validate` reports missing IMPLEMENTATION_Project_Health_Doctor.md links. |

## CONFLICTS

### DECISION: repair_core INCOMPLETE_IMPL false positive
- Conflict: Repair task claimed `get_issue_symbol` and `get_issue_action_parts` were empty, but `ngram/repair_core.py` already implements both.
- Resolution: Treat as false positive; no code changes required.
- Reasoning: Implementations exist and align with CLI SYNC note about verified helpers.
- Updated: /home/mind-protocol/ngram/.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md

### DECISION: tui/state.py INCOMPLETE_IMPL false positive
- Conflict: Repair task claimed multiple methods in `ngram/tui/state.py` were empty, but implementations are present.
- Resolution: Treat as false positive; no code changes required.
- Reasoning: Methods already implement history, agent output, and session state helpers.
- Updated: /home/mind-protocol/ngram/.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md

### DECISION: tui/widgets/status_bar.py INCOMPLETE_IMPL false positive
- Conflict: Repair task claimed `set_folder`, `update_health`, `set_repair_progress`, `_start_animation`, `_animate`, and `_refresh_display` were empty, but implementations are present.
- Resolution: Treat as false positive; no code changes required.
- Reasoning: Methods already update display state, animation timers, and health/progress rendering.
- Updated: /home/mind-protocol/ngram/.ngram/state/SYNC_Project_State.md

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Likely VIEW for continuing:** `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md`

**Current focus:** Keep doctor-ignore aligned with actual TUI implementation and update SYNCs when suppressing findings.

**Key context:**
TUI false positives are now suppressed in `.ngram/doctor-ignore.yaml`.

**Watch out for:**
Doctor flags functions with <=2 body lines as incomplete.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
Doctor false positives for TUI short methods are now suppressed, and the TUI sync reflects that change.

**Decisions made recently:**
Marked `ngram/tui/app.py` and related widgets as intentional minimal implementations in doctor-ignore.

**Needs your input:**
None.

**Concerns:**
None.

---

## TODO

### High Priority

- [ ] None.

### Backlog

- [ ] None.

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Project momentum:**
Steady, small maintenance fixes.

**Architectural concerns:**
None noted for this change.

**Opportunities noticed:**
Consider auto-syncing doctor-ignore additions into module SYNC entries.

---

## AREAS

| Area | Status | SYNC |
|------|--------|------|
| `tui/` | implemented | `docs/tui/SYNC_TUI_State.md` |

---

## MODULE COVERAGE

Check `modules.yaml` (project root) for full manifest.

**Mapped modules:**
| Module | Code | Docs | Maturity |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| cli | `ngram/*.py` | `docs/cli/` | CANONICAL |
| tui | `ngram/tui/**` | `docs/tui/` | CANONICAL |

**Unmapped code:** (run `ngram validate` to check)
- None noted after CLI/TUI mappings.

**Coverage notes:**

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- doctor-ignore now reflects TUI false positives that were already documented in TUI sync.
- `ngram validate` fails due to missing `IMPLEMENTATION_Project_Health_Doctor.md` references.
- `ngram/tui/state.py` INCOMPLETE_IMPL report was outdated; functions already implemented.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Add module mappings in `modules.yaml` for `ngram/tui/**` to avoid unmapped warnings.

### Propositions
- Consider a helper that syncs doctor-ignore entries into module SYNC entries automatically.
The module manifest is still in template form; mapping work is pending.
