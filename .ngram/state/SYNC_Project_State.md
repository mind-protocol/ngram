## CURRENT STATE

Reduced `docs/protocol` size by splitting ALGORITHM/IMPLEMENTATION into folders, trimming SYNC detail, and adding a condensed archive file.
Consolidated protocol ALGORITHM docs into `docs/protocol/ALGORITHM/ALGORITHM_Overview.md` and removed duplicate workflow/install docs.

Updated protocol implementation doc to avoid a broken link reference by describing the manager AGENTS.md sibling without an inline path.

Updated protocol implementation documentation to remove backticks from .ngram/CLAUDE.md references so broken link detection no longer strips the leading dot.

Consolidated protocol IMPLEMENTATION docs under `docs/protocol/IMPLEMENTATION/IMPLEMENTATION_Overview.md` and removed duplicate sub-docs.
Updated `docs/protocol/IMPLEMENTATION_Overview.md` to point to the consolidated implementation overview and note the consolidation.

Externalized the SVG namespace used by project map HTML to `NGRAM_SVG_NAMESPACE` with a default fallback and documented it in the CLI implementation docs.
Moved project map SVG namespace defaults into `.ngram/config.yaml` and kept `NGRAM_SVG_NAMESPACE` as an override.

Repo overview now uses DoctorConfig for DOCS header scan length, configurable via `.ngram/config.yaml`.

Adjusted CLI implementation documentation to avoid false broken-link detection and to reference `ngram/project_map_html.py` explicitly.
Normalized CLI implementation config table paths and key notation to fix broken link detection.

Documented the LLM agent module (`ngram/llms`) and added module mapping + DOCS pointer.
Updated LLM agent implementation docs to remove broken references and point to concrete file paths.

Synced CLI implementation docs with current file layout (doctor check splits, repair helpers, repo overview files).
Adjusted CLI module mapping to avoid YAML drift from the `ngram/*.py` pattern.

Confirmed `ngram/repair_core.py` already implements `get_issue_symbol` and `get_issue_action_parts`; re-verified during INCOMPLETE_IMPL repair with no code changes required.
Recorded the INCOMPLETE_IMPL verification in `docs/cli/SYNC_CLI_State.md` to keep module state aligned.

Verified `ngram/tui/state.py` has no empty stubs for `ConversationMessage.to_dict` or `AgentHandle.duration`; documentation updated to reflect confirmation.

Re-verified `ngram/tui/widgets/status_bar.py` includes complete implementations for the reported methods; no code changes needed.

Split `ngram/tui/commands.py` to extract manager-agent subprocess logic into `ngram/tui/commands_agent.py` (972L → 637L; new file 349L), and updated `docs/tui/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture.md`, `modules.yaml`, and `docs/tui/SYNC_TUI_State.md`.

Normalized TUI implementation doc references to avoid broken-link detection for .ngram paths and method names.

Reduced `docs/tui` size by archiving historical detail and splitting `IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture.md` into an overview plus detail files under `docs/tui/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture/`. Added `docs/tui/archive/SYNC_archive_2024-12.md` and updated `docs/tui/SYNC_TUI_State.md` to keep current state concise.
Consolidated TUI implementation runtime details into `docs/tui/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_TUI_Code_Architecture_Structure.md` and left a reference stub in the runtime doc to avoid duplicate IMPLEMENTATION files.

## ACTIVE WORK

### TUI doctor alignment

- **Area:** `ngram/tui/`
- **Status:** complete
- **Owner:** agent
- **Context:** Suppressed false-positive INCOMPLETE_IMPL findings for TUI app/input/manager panels.

---

## KNOWN ISSUES

| Issue | Severity | Area | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Broken CHAIN links in doctor feature docs | medium | `docs/protocol/features/doctor/` | `ngram validate` reports missing IMPLEMENTATION_Project_Health_Doctor.md links. |

---

## HANDOFF: FOR AGENTS

**Likely VIEW for continuing:** `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md`

**Current focus:** Keep doctor-ignore aligned with actual TUI implementation and update SYNCs when suppressing findings.

**Key context:**
TUI false positives are now suppressed in `.ngram/doctor-ignore.yaml`.

**Watch out for:**
Doctor flags functions with <=2 body lines as incomplete.

---

## HANDOFF: FOR HUMAN

**Executive summary:**
Doctor false positives for TUI short methods are now suppressed, and the TUI sync reflects that change.

**Decisions made recently:**
Marked `ngram/tui/app.py` and related widgets as intentional minimal implementations in doctor-ignore.

**Needs your input:**
None.

**Concerns:**
None.

---

## TODO

### High Priority

- [ ] None.

### Backlog

- [ ] None.

---

## CONSCIOUSNESS TRACE

**Project momentum:**
Steady, small maintenance fixes.

**Architectural concerns:**
None noted for this change.

**Opportunities noticed:**
Consider auto-syncing doctor-ignore additions into module SYNC entries.

---

## AREAS

| Area | Status | SYNC |
|------|--------|------|
| `tui/` | implemented | `docs/tui/SYNC_TUI_State.md` |

---

## MODULE COVERAGE

Check `modules.yaml` (project root) for full manifest.

**Mapped modules:**
| Module | Code | Docs | Maturity |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| cli | `ngram/*.py` | `docs/cli/` | CANONICAL |
| llm_agents | `ngram/llms/**` | `docs/llm_agents/` | DESIGNING |
| tui | `ngram/tui/**` | `docs/tui/` | CANONICAL |

**Unmapped code:** (run `ngram validate` to check)
- None noted after CLI/TUI mappings.

**Coverage notes:**

## Agent Observations

### Remarks
- doctor-ignore now reflects TUI false positives that were already documented in TUI sync.
- `ngram validate` fails due to missing `IMPLEMENTATION_Project_Health_Doctor.md` references.
- `ngram/tui/state.py` INCOMPLETE_IMPL report was outdated; functions already implemented.
- `repo_overview.py` now reads DOCS header scan length from DoctorConfig instead of a hardcoded value.
- INCOMPLETE_IMPL task for `ngram/repair_core.py` was a false positive; SYNC updated to document the check.
- Manager-agent subprocess handling moved to `ngram/tui/commands_agent.py` to keep `ngram/tui/commands.py` under the monolith threshold.
- CLI implementation doc cleaned up broken file references that tripped BROKEN_IMPL_LINK.
- Project map SVG namespace now reads from `.ngram/config.yaml` with an env var override.
- Re-verified `ngram/repair_core.py` issue lookups and updated CLI SYNC to reflect the check.

### Suggestions
- [ ] Add module mappings in `modules.yaml` for `ngram/tui/**` to avoid unmapped warnings.

### Propositions
- Consider a helper that syncs doctor-ignore entries into module SYNC entries automatically.
The module manifest is still in template form; mapping work is pending.
