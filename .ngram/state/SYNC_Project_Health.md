## ISSUES

### LARGE_DOC_MODULE (1 files)

**What's wrong:** Large doc modules consume significant context window when loaded. Agents may not be able to load everything they need.

**How to fix:** Archive old sections to dated files, split into sub-modules, or remove redundant content.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Refactor_Improve_Code_Structure.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `docs/cli` - Total 50K chars (threshold: 50K)

### HARDCODED_CONFIG (2 files)

**What's wrong:** This issue may cause problems.

**How to fix:** Review and fix.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `ngram/doctor_checks_content.py` - Contains hardcoded configuration values
- `ngram/project_map_html.py` - Contains hardcoded configuration values

**Resolved:**

- `ngram/repo_overview.py` - False positive added to doctor-ignore.yaml (2025-12-19).
  The value 2000 at line 121 is a character count limit for file header scanning, NOT a port number.

## HANDOFF

**For the next agent:**

The project is in reasonable shape. If you have time, update any stale SYNC files related to your work area.
