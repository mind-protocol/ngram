## ISSUES

### MONOLITH (2 files)

**What's wrong:** Large files are hard to navigate, test, and maintain. They slow down agents who need to load context, and changes become risky because side effects are hard to predict.

**How to fix:** Extract cohesive functionality into separate modules. Start with the largest functions/classes listed above.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Refactor_Improve_Code_Structure.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `src/ngram/doctor_checks.py` - 1411 lines (threshold: 800)
  - Split: def doctor_check_doc_duplication() (160L, :1273), def doctor_check_new_undoc_code() (127L, :655), def doctor_check_long_strings() (94L, :1645)
- `src/ngram/repair.py` - 1386 lines (threshold: 800)
  - Split: def repair_command() (439L, :1236), def run_repair() (291L, :1384), def spawn_repair_agent() (224L, :514)

### INCOMPLETE_IMPL (1 files)

**What's wrong:** Empty functions indicate incomplete implementation. The interface exists but the behavior doesn't.

**How to fix:** Fill in the empty functions with actual implementation.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `src/ngram/repair.py` - Contains 5 empty/incomplete function(s)

### LARGE_DOC_MODULE (1 files)

**What's wrong:** Large doc modules consume significant context window when loaded. Agents may not be able to load everything they need.

**How to fix:** Archive old sections to dated files, split into sub-modules, or remove redundant content.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Refactor_Improve_Code_Structure.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `docs/cli` - Total 53K chars (threshold: 50K)

### HARDCODED_CONFIG (2 files)

**What's wrong:** This issue may cause problems.

**How to fix:** Review and fix.

**Protocol:** Load `VIEW_Implement_Write_Or_Modify_Code.md` before starting.

**Files:**

- `src/ngram/project_map_html.py` - Contains hardcoded configuration values
- `src/ngram/doctor_checks.py` - Contains hardcoded configuration values

## HANDOFF

**For the next agent:**

Before starting your task, consider addressing critical issues - especially if your work touches affected files. Monoliths and undocumented code will slow you down.

**Recommended first action:** Pick one MONOLITH file you'll be working in and split its largest function into a separate module.
